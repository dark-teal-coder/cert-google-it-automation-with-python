They can become tired, make mistakes, fail to follow instructions, be inconsistent in their job performance, and more. In contrast, automated processes complete instructions exactly as coded, in a consistent manner. They can run 24 hours a day, everyday, without tiring. For many tasks that are appropriate for automation, it can be more cost effective to use automation than human labor. \n",

        "- The automatic timing and regulation of traffic lights\n",

        "- Reporting on system data, like disk or memory usage\n",

Sometimes automation can be used to perform one or more subtasks of a larger set of tasks – but – human intervention is required to complete the tasks. The following are some examples of tasks that cannot or should not be fully automated:\n",

This process prepares the AI software to perform new tasks without a human needing to program explicit instructions for each task. Although AI is often used for automating human tasks, AI automation is much more complex than basic automation.\n",

Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.\n",

        "> ***Syntax***: Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.\n",

It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++,  R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Script***: Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.\n",

        "> ***Automation***: Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. \n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Output***: Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. \n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Input***: Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Functions***: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",

        "When writing code, using correct syntax is critical. Even a small typo, like a missing parenthesis bracket or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes. A single wrong character could take hours to identify in long code so it is important to be mindful of syntax when writing code. \n",

        "Common syntax errors: \n",
        "- Misspellings\n",
        "- Incorrect indentations\n",
        "- Missing or incorrect key characters:\n",
        "  - Bracket types - `(` curved `)`, `[` square `]`, `{` curly `}`\n",
        "  - Quote types - `\"`straight-double`\"` or `'`straight-single`'`, `“`curly-double`”` or `‘`curly-single`’`\n",
        "  - Block introduction characters, like colons - `:`\n",
        "- Data type mismatches\n",
        "- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words\n",
        "- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language \n",
        "\n",
        "If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Syntax is like the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of code. Semantics are the meaning and logic of coded statements. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.\n",
        "\n",

They can become tired, make mistakes, fail to follow instructions, be inconsistent in their job performance, and more. In contrast, automated processes complete instructions exactly as coded, in a consistent manner. They can run 24 hours a day, everyday, without tiring. For many tasks that are appropriate for automation, it can be more cost effective to use automation than human labor. \n",
        "\n",
        "Appropriate uses for automation include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The automatic timing and regulation of traffic lights\n",
        "- A repetitive task that is at high risk for human error\n",

Tasks that call for human creativity, social connection, psychology, flexibility, ingenuity, evaluation, and/or complex analytic work are not good candidates for full automation. Sometimes automation can be used to perform one or more subtasks of a larger set of tasks – but – human intervention is required to complete the tasks. The following are some examples of tasks that cannot or should not be fully automated:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Items that require human evaluation and analytic skills:\n",
        "  - Designing a configuration management system\n",

        "  - Wedding photography\n",
        "  - Haircuts and styling\n",
        "- Items that cannot be automated due to basic physics:\n",
        "  - Troubleshooting or repairing machines that cannot power on or boot up \n",

Artificial intelligence (AI) involves training a computing machine to perform more complex tasks through a process called machine learning. This process prepares the AI software to perform new tasks without a human needing to program explicit instructions for each task.

        "##### Key Terms\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Programming code***: Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Programming languages***: Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Syntax***: Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Semantics*** Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Computer program***: A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++,  R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Script***: Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Automation***: Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. \n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Output***: Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. \n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Input***: Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Functions***: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Variables***: Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code. \n",

        "\n",
        "When writing code, using correct syntax is critical. Even a small typo, like a missing parenthesis bracket or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes. A single wrong character could take hours to identify in long code so it is important to be mindful of syntax when writing code. \n",

        "Common syntax errors: \n",
        "- Misspellings\n",
        "- Incorrect indentations\n",
        "- Missing or incorrect key characters:\n",
        "  - Bracket types - `(` curved `)`, `[` square `]`, `{` curly `}`\n",
        "  - Quote types - `\"`straight-double`\"` or `'`straight-single`'`, `“`curly-double`”` or `‘`curly-single`’`\n",
        "  - Block introduction characters, like colons - `:`\n",
        "- Data type mismatches\n",
        "- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words\n",
        "- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language \n",
        "\n",
        "If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Syntax is like the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of code. Semantics are the meaning and logic of coded statements. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Basic building blocks of Python syntax: e.g., vriables, expressions, functions, conditional blocks, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 02.01.02 Reading: Explore Python Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a flexible programming language used in a wide range of fields, including software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, so getting familiar with its fundamental syntax and semantics will be useful for your future career. In this reading, you will learn about Python’s syntax and semantics, as well as where to find resources to further your learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### The Language of Python\n",
        "\n",
        "People use language to communicate and give instructions to each other. Computers do the same thing, except computers use languages like Python, C++, and Java. So, in order to communicate instructions to the computer, programmers need to arrange ideas and concepts into a language it will understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python syntax includes words that represent objects and commands, as well as punctuation that gives the words structure, hierarchy, and context. Together, the words and punctuation communicate ideas and processes; this is known as semantics. Semantics is the meaning conveyed by the syntax. The best way to learn syntax and semantics is through exposure. Practice coding and become familiar and comfortable with reading other people’s code. In addition, there are some general conventions that practitioners use to help maintain stylistic uniformity within the language. \n",
        "\n",
        "Coding languages are similar to spoken languages in that they have a way to classify words according to their function. For example, English sentences are composed of nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc. Here are some of the basics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- > ***Variables***: Represent data stored as strings, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and objects (note: future readings explain these categories)\n",
        "\n",
        "- > ***Keywords***: Special words that are reserved for specific purposes and that can only be used for those purposes\n",
        "  - e.g., `in`, `not`, `or`, `for`, `while`, `return`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "- > ***Operators***: Symbols that perform operations on objects and values\n",
        "  - i.e., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`, `//`, `>`, `<`, and `==`\n",
        "\n",
        "- >***Expressions***: A combination of numbers, symbols, and variables to compute and return a result upon evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "- >***Functions***: A group of related statements to perform a task and return a value\n",
        "  - e.g.,\n",
        "\t```python\n",
        "\tdef to_celsius(x):\n",
        "\t   '''Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius'''\n",
        "\t   return (x-32) * 5/9\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\tto_celsius(75)\n",
        "\t```\n",
        "\n",
        "- >***Conditional statements***: Sections of code that direct program execution based on specified conditions\n",
        "  - e.g., \n",
        "\t```python\n",
        "\tnumber = -4\n",
        "\n",
        "\tif number > 0:\n",
        "\t   print('Number is positive.')\n",
        "\telif number == 0:\n",
        "\t   print('Number is zero.')\n",
        "\telse:\n",
        "\t   print('Number is negative.')\n",
        "\t```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Naming Rules and Conventions\n",
        "\n",
        "When assigning names to objects, programmers adhere to a set of rules and conventions which help to standardize code and make it more accessible to everyone. Here are some naming rules and conventions that you should know:\n",
        "- Names cannot contain spaces.\n",
        "- Names may be a mixture of upper and lower case characters.\n",
        "- Names can’t start with a number but may contain numbers after the first character.\n",
        "- Variable names and function names should be written in snake_case, which means that all letters are lowercase and words are separated using an underscore. \n",
        "- Descriptive names are better than cryptic abbreviations because they help other programmers (and you) read and interpret your code. For example, student_name is better than sn. It may feel excessive when you write it, but when you return to your code you’ll find it much easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is a more exhaustive resource for style-related matters. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals. These are a running catalog of ways to improve or standardize Python as a language. Because Python is open source, PEP offers a framework to guide developers and build consensus around ideas. It’s a useful and trusted resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax and semantics are what give form and meaning to a language, including Python.  A large part of learning a new language is familiarizing yourself with its syntax and semantics. Much of this comes through exposure and practice, but there are a few guiding principles and resources that can help you along the way. If you learn the rules about naming objects and build a bank of resources that you can reference for guidance, you’ll surely make progress as a Python learner. As you get more familiar with Python, you’ll be able to communicate more efficiently with computers and do more with your data analysis tools!\n",

        "#### 02.01.05 Reading: Annotating Variables by Type\n",
        "\n",
        "Type annotation allows you to clearly communicate the argument types and return type of functions in your code. It’s like giving yourself and other developers hints about what kind of data the variable is supposed to hold. This has several benefits: It reduces the chance of common mistakes, helps in documenting your code for others to reuse, and allows integrated development software (IDEs) and other tools to give you better feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this reading, you will learn more about annotating variables by type and best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### How to Annotate a Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of annotating a variable as if you were to put a label on a container—and anything in that container should hold what the label is describing. Let’s take a look at an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "name: str = “Betty”\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The variable name is declared using a colon (`:`) which is annotated with the type `str`, indicating that the name variable should hold a string value. And look, it does! Betty—or any name for that matter—is a string, and we know it’s a string because it is in quotes. Let’s look at another example where a variable holds an integer value.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "age: int = 34\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `age` is the variable, and `int` is the type annotation that provides you and other developers a hint that the age variable should store an integer value.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Pro tip: If a function expects a list of integers, you should annotate it as `List[int]`, not just `List`. Being specific with your types can catch more potential bugs and misunderstandings.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Dynamic Typing\n",
        "\n",
        "Many languages, such as C# or Java, require you to declare variable types, but not Python. One of the great things about Python is that the type of variable can change over time as new values are assigned to it. For example: \n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "a = 3                  #a is an integer\n",
        "a = “Hello world”      #a is now a string\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic typing allows programmers to write code more quickly and offers flexibility because you don’t have to explicitly declare the type of variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: Python decides which of the built-in types the variable is and, therefore, how it should behave. For more information, refer to this article on [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). \n",
        "\n",
        "##### Duck Typing\n",
        "\n",
        "This form of typing comes from the saying, “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.” Python will infer the variable type at runtime and decide which behaviors are available to the given object.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "a = “Hello world”      #looks like a string\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Annotating Variables with Type Comments\n",
        "\n",
        "Another way to annotate variables is to use type comments where the interpreter will ignore the comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "captain = “Picard”      # type: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: This way of annotating variables might be useful for cases when you need to know what types belong to which variables but do not want the overhead of using a line interpreter (linter) or IDE on this specific variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Annotating Variables Directly\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s use the same example above to annotate a variable directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "captain: str = “Picard”\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: You might hear annotating variables directly called the more “modern” way to annotate a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another advantage is that you can use automated tools such as linters, or mypy, to check types to make code more resilient. Most modern IDEs, such as VS Code and JetBrains PyCharm, scan code for type annotations and can use it to help you write better code more quickly!\n",
        "\n",
        "##### How Type Annotations Affect Runtime Behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "Any time a library is called, or an IDE works to scan your code, more computational overhead is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Pro tip: Be strategic when annotating variables by type. This can add unnecessary overhead when overused.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type annotation is less common with Python users in data science, as it can be burdensome to manually map data every time a new set of data comes in. On the other hand, when doing object-oriented programming or writing functions, using type annotations becomes extremely important because it helps clarify code since you are dealing with more than just the built-in types.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "Annotating variables by type provides programmers with benefits to make the code easier to read and understand. Python provides different options on how to annotate variables, so choose how you want to annotate them. Just be cautious of over-annotating, creating unnecessary overhead to your code.\n",

        "\n",
        "By contrast, explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. We used this in our video example when we wanted to print a number alongside some text. Before we could do that, we needed to call the `str()` function to convert the number into a string. Once the number was explicitly converted to a string, we could join it with the rest of our textual string and print the result.\n",

        "##### Built-in Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last video, we explored built-in functions in Python, including `print()`, `type()`, and `str()`. \n",
        "\n",
        "> ***Built-in functions***: Functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this reading, you’ll explore these further and also learn about the `sorted()` function and `max()` and `min()` function. In addition, you'll review how to pass the output of one function into another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### `print()`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `print()` function outputs a specified object to the screen. The `print()` function is one of the most commonly used functions in Python because it allows you to output any detail from your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the `print()` function, you pass the object you want to print as an argument to the function. The `print()` function takes in any number of arguments, separated by a comma, and prints all of them. For example, you can run the following code that prints a string, a variable, another string, and an integer together:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "month = \"September\"\n",
        "print(\"Investigate failed login attempts during\", month, \"if more than\", 100)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### `type()`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `type()` function returns the data type of its argument. The `type()` function helps you keep track of the data types of variables to avoid errors throughout your code. \n",
        "\n",
        "To use it, you pass the object as an argument, and it returns its data type. It only accepts one argument. For example, you could specify `type(\"security\")` or `type(7)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Passing One Function into Another\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with functions, you often need to pass them through print() if you want to output the data type to the screen. This is the case when using a function like type(). Consider the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(type(\"This is a string\"))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "It displays `<class 'str'>`, which means that the argument passed to the `type()` function is a string. This happens because the `type()` function is processed first and its output is passed as an argument to the `print()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### `str()`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `str()` function can be used to convert any data type to a string. The `str()` function takes a single argument, which is the value that you want to convert to a string. The `str()` function will then return a string representation of the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `str()` function will convert the number 12 to a string. This will run the code and print the string representation of the number.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "number = 12\n",
        "string_representation = str(number)\n",
        "print(string_representation)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### `sorted()`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `sorted()` function sorts the components of a list. The `sorted()` function also works on any iterable, like a string, and returns the sorted elements in a list. By default, it sorts them in ascending order. When given an iterable that contains numbers, it sorts them from smallest to largest; this includes iterables that contain numeric data as well as iterables that contain string data beginning with numbers. An iterable that contains strings that begin with alphabetic characters will be sorted alphabetically.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `sorted()` function takes an iterable, like a list or a string, as an input. So, for example, you can use the following code to sort the list of login sessions from shortest to longest:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
        "print(sorted(time_list))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This displays the sorted list. \n",
        "\n",
        "The `sorted()` function does not change the iterable that it sorts. The following code illustrates this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
        "print(sorted(time_list))\n",
        "print(time_list)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The first `print()` function displays the sorted list. However, the second `print()` function, which does not include the `sorted()` function, displays the list as assigned to time_list in the first line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "One more important detail about the `sorted()` function is that it cannot take lists or strings that have elements of more than one data type. For example, you can’t use the list `[1, 2, \"hello\"]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### `max()` and `min()`\n",
        "\n",
        "The `max()` function returns the largest numeric input passed into it. The `min()` function returns the smallest numeric input passed into it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `max()` and `min()` functions accept arguments of either multiple numeric values or of an iterable like a list, and they return the largest or smallest value respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you could use these functions to identify the longest or shortest session that a user logged in for. If a specific user logged in seven times during a week, and you stored their access times in minutes in a list, you can use the `max()` and `min()` functions to find and print their longest and shortest sessions:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
        "print(min(time_list))\n",
        "print(max(time_list))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "Built-in functions are powerful tools in Python that allow you to perform tasks with one simple command. The `print()` function prints its arguments to the screen, the `type()` function returns the data type of its argument, the `sorted()` organizes its argument, and the `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest values of an iterable respectively.\n",

        "\n",
        "Logical operators are used to construct more complex expressions. You can make complex comparisons by joining comparison statements together using the logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`. Complex comparisons return a Boolean (`True` or `False`) result. \n",
        "\n",
        "- `and`\n",
        "  - Both sides of the statement being evaluated must be True for the whole statement to be True. \n",

        "- `or`\n",
        "  - If either side of the comparison is True, then the whole statement is True. \n",

        "##### PART 1: The `and` Logical Operator\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can use the logical operator `and` to connect more than one comparison. This type of complex comparison is used to check if two comparison statements are both True or not. You might use the `and` operator when you need to execute a block of code, but only if two different conditions are true. For example, you might want to write a script  that automates sending you an emergency alert if a server stops responding and there is an unusual increase in employees opening trouble tickets.  \n",

        "Example 1:\n",

        "In the example above, the following activities were completed by Python in the following order:  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Python solves the numerical expressions using the order of operations. `(6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2)` becomes `(18 >= 18)` and `(18 <= 18)`\n",
        "2. Python compares the results of the numerical expressions using the comparison operators (in this case `>=` and `<=`). `(18 >= 18) and (18 <= 18)` becomes `True` and `True`\n",

        "In this next example, `\"Nairobi\" < \"Milan\" and \"Nairobi\" > \"Hanoi\"`, the `and` logical operator is connecting 2 string comparison statements. You learned previously that using the greater than and less than operators on strings will test the alphabetical order (technically Unicode values) of the strings. So, this complex comparison is checking if `\"Nairobi\"` is alphabetized before `\"Milan\"` (`False`) AND after `\"Hanoi\"` (`True`). \n",

        "Building off of the `if` and `else` blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement, the `elif` statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching. Very similar to the `if` statements, an `elif` statement starts with the `elif` keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated. This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right. An `elif` statement must follow an `if` statement, and will only be evaluated if the `if` statement was evaluated as false. You can include multiple `elif` statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!\n",

On the next line is the code block to be executed, indented to the right. Similar to an `if` statement, the code in the body will only be executed if the comparison is evaluated to be true. What sets a `while` loop apart, however, is that this code block will keep executing as long as the evaluation statement is true. Once the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed.\n",

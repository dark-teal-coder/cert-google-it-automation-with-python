    "\n",
    "#### 01.02.04 Reading: Uses for Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uses for Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts can be used for automating specific tasks. Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. Humans are fallible. They can become tired, make mistakes, fail to follow instructions, be inconsistent in their job performance, and more. In contrast, automated processes complete instructions exactly as coded, in a consistent manner. They can run 24 hours a day, everyday, without tiring. For many tasks that are appropriate for automation, it can be more cost effective to use automation than human labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate uses for automation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The automatic timing and regulation of traffic lights\n",
    "- A repetitive task that is at high risk for human error\n",
    "- Sending commands to a computer\n",
    "- Detecting and removing duplicates of data\n",
    "- Sending automated emails that are personalized by pulling individual names from a database and plugging them into the email \n",
    "- Updating a large number of file permissions\n",
    "- Reporting on system data, like disk or memory usage\n",
    "- Installing software\n",
    "- Generating reports\n",
    "- Deploying a file or a computer program to all computers on a company network\n",
    "- Using a configuration management system to deploy software patches, after a human has designed the system\n",
    "- Populating an e-commerce site with products\n",
    "- Setting the home directory and access permissions for users\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Automation Is Not Always an Appropriate or Complete Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation cannot perform all human work. Tasks that call for human creativity, social connection, psychology, flexibility, ingenuity, evaluation, and/or complex analytic work are not good candidates for full automation. Sometimes automation can be used to perform one or more subtasks of a larger set of tasks – but – human intervention is required to complete the tasks. The following are some examples of tasks that cannot or should not be fully automated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Items that require human evaluation and analytic skills:\n",
    "  - Designing a configuration management system\n",
    "  - Investigating and troubleshooting all end user problems\n",
    "  - Writing a computer program\n",
    "  - Building a new startup business\n",
    "- Items that require human creativity and/or an eye for aesthetic qualities:\n",
    "  - Designing an attractive webpage (AI can do this, but simple automation cannot) \n",
    "  - Wedding photography\n",
    "  - Haircuts and styling\n",
    "- Items that cannot be automated due to basic physics:\n",
    "  - Troubleshooting or repairing machines that cannot power on or boot up \n",
    "- Items that need human interaction, psychology, and/or evaluation skills:\n",
    "  - Interviewing and hiring new employees\n",
    "  - Customer service (chat bots cannot address every customer service need)\n",
    "- Items that should not be fully automated due to costs and safety:\n",
    "  - Grocery store checkout process, including bagging groceries\n",
    "  - Tasks that are less expensive to perform manually\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that basic automation is not the same as artificial intelligence. Automation is used to explicitly instruct a machine on how to perform a task. Artificial intelligence (AI) involves training a computing machine to perform more complex tasks through a process called machine learning. This process prepares the AI software to perform new tasks without a human needing to program explicit instructions for each task. Although AI is often used for automating human tasks, AI automation is much more complex than basic automation.\n",

    "- Working in IT, a lot of what we do boils down to using a computer to perform a certain task. In your job you might create user accounts, configure the network, install software, backup existing data, or execute a whole range of other computer based tasks from day to day.\n",
    "- Tasks performed by a computer that need to be done multiple times with little variation are really well suited for automation, because when you automate a task you avoid the possibility of human errors, and reduce the time it takes to do it.\n",
    "- Automating tasks allows you to focus on projects that are a better use of your time, letting computers do the boring stuff for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 01.02.06 Reading: Study Guide: Introduction to Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first practice quiz is coming up soon. This handy study guide should help you prepare for that quiz. The practice quizzes do not count towards your grade in this course. Practice quizzes are opportunities for you to check your understanding of the materials before you take the graded assessments at the end of each module.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Programming code***: Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Programming languages***: Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Syntax***: Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Semantics*** Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Computer program***: A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++,  R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Script***: Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Automation***: Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Output***: Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Input***: Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Functions***: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Variables***: Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code. \n",

    "When writing code, using correct syntax is critical. Even a small typo, like a missing parenthesis bracket or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes. A single wrong character could take hours to identify in long code so it is important to be mindful of syntax when writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common syntax errors: \n",
    "- Misspellings\n",
    "- Incorrect indentations\n",
    "- Missing or incorrect key characters:\n",
    "  - Bracket types - `(` curved `)`, `[` square `]`, `{` curly `}`\n",
    "  - Quote types - `\"`straight-double`\"` or `'`straight-single`'`, `“`curly-double`”` or `‘`curly-single`’`\n",
    "  - Block introduction characters, like colons - `:`\n",
    "- Data type mismatches\n",
    "- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words\n",
    "- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language \n",
    "\n",
    "If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Syntax is like the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of code. Semantics are the meaning and logic of coded statements. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common semantic errors:\n",
    "- Creating functional code, but getting unintentional output\n",
    "- Poor logic structures in the design of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with the code blocks in exercises for this course, be mindful of syntax and semantic (logic) errors, along with the overall result of your code. Just because you fixed an error doesn't mean that the code will have the desired effect when it runs! Once you’ve fixed an error in your code, don't forget to click Run to check your work.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this segment, you learned that Python is a general purpose programming language that is commonly used for scripting and automation, as well as to develop a wide variety of applications. Python is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and is updated every few years. Python can also run on a variety of machines, such as servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is widely used in the IT field, including IT support, system administration, web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Python can be used to calculate statistics, run your e-commerce site, process images, interact with web services, and do a whole host of other tasks. Python instructions resemble the English language, which is what makes it easier to learn and understand when compared to other programming languages.\n",

    "| `Hello, how are you?`             | `Hello, how are you?`         |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language***: Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Client-side scripting language***: Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Machine language***: Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Cross-platform language***: Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Object-oriented programming language***: In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Python interpreter***: An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.\n",

    "##### Reminder: Correct Syntax is Critical\n",
    "\n",
    "Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now. \n",
    "\n",
    "No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately, you have 3 optional retake opportunities on the graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimited retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before starting the graded quiz, review this list of common syntax errors coders make when writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common syntax errors:\n",
    "- Misspellings\n",
    "- Incorrect indentations\n",
    "- Missing or incorrect key characters:\n",
    "- Parenthetical types - `(` curved `)`, `[` square `]`, `{` curly `}`\n",
    "- Quote types - `\"`straight-double`\"` or `'`straight-single`'`, `“`curly-double`”` or `‘`curly-single`’`\n",
    "- Block introduction characters, like colons - `:`\n",
    "- Data type mismatches\n",
    "- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words\n",
    "- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language \n",

    "\n",
    "Basic building blocks of Python syntax: e.g., vriables, expressions, functions, conditional blocks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 02.01.02 Reading: Explore Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language used in a wide range of fields, including software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, so getting familiar with its fundamental syntax and semantics will be useful for your future career. In this reading, you will learn about Python’s syntax and semantics, as well as where to find resources to further your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Language of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "People use language to communicate and give instructions to each other. Computers do the same thing, except computers use languages like Python, C++, and Java. So, in order to communicate instructions to the computer, programmers need to arrange ideas and concepts into a language it will understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax includes words that represent objects and commands, as well as punctuation that gives the words structure, hierarchy, and context. Together, the words and punctuation communicate ideas and processes; this is known as semantics. Semantics is the meaning conveyed by the syntax. The best way to learn syntax and semantics is through exposure. Practice coding and become familiar and comfortable with reading other people’s code. In addition, there are some general conventions that practitioners use to help maintain stylistic uniformity within the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coding languages are similar to spoken languages in that they have a way to classify words according to their function. For example, English sentences are composed of nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc. Here are some of the basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Variables***: Represent data stored as strings, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and objects (note: future readings explain these categories)\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Keywords***: Special words that are reserved for specific purposes and that can only be used for those purposes\n",
    "  - e.g., `in`, `not`, `or`, `for`, `while`, `return`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Operators***: Symbols that perform operations on objects and values\n",
    "  - i.e., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`, `//`, `>`, `<`, and `==`\n",
    "\n",
    "- >***Expressions***: A combination of numbers, symbols, and variables to compute and return a result upon evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- >***Functions***: A group of related statements to perform a task and return a value\n",
    "  - e.g.,\n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\tdef to_celsius(x):\n",
    "\t   '''Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius'''\n",
    "\t   return (x-32) * 5/9\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\tto_celsius(75)\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\n",
    "- >***Conditional statements***: Sections of code that direct program execution based on specified conditions\n",
    "  - e.g., \n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\tnumber = -4\n",
    "\n",
    "\tif number > 0:\n",
    "\t   print('Number is positive.')\n",
    "\telif number == 0:\n",
    "\t   print('Number is zero.')\n",
    "\telse:\n",
    "\t   print('Number is negative.')\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Naming Rules and Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "When assigning names to objects, programmers adhere to a set of rules and conventions which help to standardize code and make it more accessible to everyone. Here are some naming rules and conventions that you should know:\n",
    "- Names cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "- Names may be a mixture of upper and lower case characters.\n",
    "- Names can’t start with a number but may contain numbers after the first character.\n",
    "- Variable names and function names should be written in snake_case, which means that all letters are lowercase and words are separated using an underscore. \n",
    "- Descriptive names are better than cryptic abbreviations because they help other programmers (and you) read and interpret your code. For example, student_name is better than sn. It may feel excessive when you write it, but when you return to your code you’ll find it much easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is a more exhaustive resource for style-related matters. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals. These are a running catalog of ways to improve or standardize Python as a language. Because Python is open source, PEP offers a framework to guide developers and build consensus around ideas. It’s a useful and trusted resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax and semantics are what give form and meaning to a language, including Python.  A large part of learning a new language is familiarizing yourself with its syntax and semantics. Much of this comes through exposure and practice, but there are a few guiding principles and resources that can help you along the way. If you learn the rules about naming objects and build a bank of resources that you can reference for guidance, you’ll surely make progress as a Python learner. As you get more familiar with Python, you’ll be able to communicate more efficiently with computers and do more with your data analysis tools!\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 02.01.05 Reading: Annotating Variables by Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotation allows you to clearly communicate the argument types and return type of functions in your code. It’s like giving yourself and other developers hints about what kind of data the variable is supposed to hold. This has several benefits: It reduces the chance of common mistakes, helps in documenting your code for others to reuse, and allows integrated development software (IDEs) and other tools to give you better feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn more about annotating variables by type and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Annotate a Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of annotating a variable as if you were to put a label on a container—and anything in that container should hold what the label is describing. Let’s take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name: str = “Betty”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable name is declared using a colon (`:`) which is annotated with the type `str`, indicating that the name variable should hold a string value. And look, it does! Betty—or any name for that matter—is a string, and we know it’s a string because it is in quotes. Let’s look at another example where a variable holds an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age: int = 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `age` is the variable, and `int` is the type annotation that provides you and other developers a hint that the age variable should store an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: If a function expects a list of integers, you should annotate it as `List[int]`, not just `List`. Being specific with your types can catch more potential bugs and misunderstandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages, such as C# or Java, require you to declare variable types, but not Python. One of the great things about Python is that the type of variable can change over time as new values are assigned to it. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3                  #a is an integer\n",
    "a = “Hello world”      #a is now a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing allows programmers to write code more quickly and offers flexibility because you don’t have to explicitly declare the type of variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Python decides which of the built-in types the variable is and, therefore, how it should behave. For more information, refer to this article on [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of typing comes from the saying, “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.” Python will infer the variable type at runtime and decide which behaviors are available to the given object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = “Hello world”      #looks like a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Annotating Variables with Type Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to annotate variables is to use type comments where the interpreter will ignore the comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "captain = “Picard”      # type: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This way of annotating variables might be useful for cases when you need to know what types belong to which variables but do not want the overhead of using a line interpreter (linter) or IDE on this specific variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Annotating Variables Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use the same example above to annotate a variable directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "captain: str = “Picard”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You might hear annotating variables directly called the more “modern” way to annotate a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that you can use automated tools such as linters, or mypy, to check types to make code more resilient. Most modern IDEs, such as VS Code and JetBrains PyCharm, scan code for type annotations and can use it to help you write better code more quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Type Annotations Affect Runtime Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time a library is called, or an IDE works to scan your code, more computational overhead is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: Be strategic when annotating variables by type. This can add unnecessary overhead when overused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotation is less common with Python users in data science, as it can be burdensome to manually map data every time a new set of data comes in. On the other hand, when doing object-oriented programming or writing functions, using type annotations becomes extremely important because it helps clarify code since you are dealing with more than just the built-in types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotating variables by type provides programmers with benefits to make the code easier to read and understand. Python provides different options on how to annotate variables, so choose how you want to annotate them. Just be cautious of over-annotating, creating unnecessary overhead to your code.\n",

    "As we saw earlier in the video, some data types can be mixed and matched due to implicit conversion. Implicit conversion is where the interpreter helps us out and automatically converts one data type into another, without having to explicitly tell it to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. We used this in our video example when we wanted to print a number alongside some text. Before we could do that, we needed to call the `str()` function to convert the number into a string. Once the number was explicitly converted to a string, we could join it with the rest of our textual string and print the result.\n",

    "#### 02.02.03 Reading: Built-in Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Built-in Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last video, we explored built-in functions in Python, including `print()`, `type()`, and `str()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Built-in functions***: Functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll explore these further and also learn about the `sorted()` function and `max()` and `min()` function. In addition, you'll review how to pass the output of one function into another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `print()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function outputs a specified object to the screen. The `print()` function is one of the most commonly used functions in Python because it allows you to output any detail from your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `print()` function, you pass the object you want to print as an argument to the function. The `print()` function takes in any number of arguments, separated by a comma, and prints all of them. For example, you can run the following code that prints a string, a variable, another string, and an integer together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "month = \"September\"\n",
    "print(\"Investigate failed login attempts during\", month, \"if more than\", 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `type()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `type()` function returns the data type of its argument. The `type()` function helps you keep track of the data types of variables to avoid errors throughout your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you pass the object as an argument, and it returns its data type. It only accepts one argument. For example, you could specify `type(\"security\")` or `type(7)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Passing One Function into Another\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with functions, you often need to pass them through print() if you want to output the data type to the screen. This is the case when using a function like type(). Consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(type(\"This is a string\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It displays `<class 'str'>`, which means that the argument passed to the `type()` function is a string. This happens because the `type()` function is processed first and its output is passed as an argument to the `print()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `str()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str()` function can be used to convert any data type to a string. The `str()` function takes a single argument, which is the value that you want to convert to a string. The `str()` function will then return a string representation of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `str()` function will convert the number 12 to a string. This will run the code and print the string representation of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 12\n",
    "string_representation = str(number)\n",
    "print(string_representation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `sorted()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sorted()` function sorts the components of a list. The `sorted()` function also works on any iterable, like a string, and returns the sorted elements in a list. By default, it sorts them in ascending order. When given an iterable that contains numbers, it sorts them from smallest to largest; this includes iterables that contain numeric data as well as iterables that contain string data beginning with numbers. An iterable that contains strings that begin with alphabetic characters will be sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sorted()` function takes an iterable, like a list or a string, as an input. So, for example, you can use the following code to sort the list of login sessions from shortest to longest:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
    "print(sorted(time_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This displays the sorted list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `sorted()` function does not change the iterable that it sorts. The following code illustrates this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
    "print(sorted(time_list))\n",
    "print(time_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `print()` function displays the sorted list. However, the second `print()` function, which does not include the `sorted()` function, displays the list as assigned to time_list in the first line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more important detail about the `sorted()` function is that it cannot take lists or strings that have elements of more than one data type. For example, you can’t use the list `[1, 2, \"hello\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `max()` and `min()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max()` function returns the largest numeric input passed into it. The `min()` function returns the smallest numeric input passed into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max()` and `min()` functions accept arguments of either multiple numeric values or of an iterable like a list, and they return the largest or smallest value respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could use these functions to identify the longest or shortest session that a user logged in for. If a specific user logged in seven times during a week, and you stored their access times in minutes in a list, you can use the `max()` and `min()` functions to find and print their longest and shortest sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
    "print(min(time_list))\n",
    "print(max(time_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in functions are powerful tools in Python that allow you to perform tasks with one simple command. The `print()` function prints its arguments to the screen, the `type()` function returns the data type of its argument, the `sorted()` organizes its argument, and the `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest values of an iterable respectively.\n",

    "The following examples demonstrate how to use comparison operators with the data types `int` (integers, whole numbers) and `float` (number with a decimal point or fractional value). Comparison operators return Boolean results. As you learned previously, Boolean is a data type that can hold only one of two values: `True` or `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison operators include: \n",
    "- `==` (equality) \n",

    "- `<=` (less than or equal to)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PART 1: Equality `==` and Not Equal To `!=` Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a Boolean result: `True` or `False`. Note that Boolean data types are not string data types (Boolean `True` is not equal to the string \"True\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "- To check if two values are the same, use the equality operator: `==` \n",
    "- To check if two values are not the same, use the not equal to operator: `!=`\n",

    "print(32 == 30+2)   # The == operator checks if the 2 values are \n",
    "# True                # equal to each other. If they are equal, \n",

    "\n",
    "##### The Equality `==` Operator VS. the Equals `=` Operator \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the equality `==` comparison operator performs a different task than the equals `=` assignment operator. The equals `=` operator assigns the value on the right side of the equals `=` to the object (e.g., a variable) on the left side of the equals `=` operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn more about what comparison operators can and cannot do. If you use the `==` (equality) and `!=` (not equal to) operators with strings, you can check if two strings contain the same text or not. You can also alphabetize strings using `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to) comparison operators. As with numeric data types, comparison operators used with strings will return Boolean (`True`, `False`) results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### PART 1: Equality `==` and Not Equal to `!=` Operators with Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare strings. The equality `==` and the not equal to `!=` operators are helpful when you need to search for a specific string in a body of text, a log file, a spreadsheet, a database, and more. You can also check user input strings to compare them to another string. Note that Boolean data types are not string data types (Boolean `True` is not equal to the string `\"True\"`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The == operator can check if 2 strings are equal to each other. If they are equal, the Python interpreter returns a True result.\n",
    "print(\"a string\" == \"a string\") # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the equality == comparison is between \"4 + 5\" and 4 + 5. Since the left data type is a string and the right data type is an integer, the 2 values cannot be equal. So, the comparison returns a False result.\n",
    "print(\"4 + 5\" == 4 + 5) # False\n",
    "\n",
    "# The != operator can check if the 2 strings are NOT equal to each other. If they are indeed not equal, then Python returns a True result.\n",
    "print(\"rabbit\" != \"frog\") # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the variable event_city has been assigned the string value \"Shanghai\". This variable is compared to a static string, \"Shanghai\", using the != operator. As, the strings \"Shanghai\" and \"Shanghai\" are the same, the comparison of \"Shanghai\" != \"Shanghai\" is false. Accordingly, Python will return a False result.\n",
    "event_city = \"Shanghai\"\n",
    "print(event_city != \"Shanghai\") # False\n",

    "# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare 2 items of different data types using the equality == operator. The 2 items are not equal, so the comparison returns False.\n",
    "print(\"three\" == 3) #False\n",

    "\n",
    "##### PART 2: The Greater Than `>` and Less Than `<` Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison operators greater than `>` and less than `<` can be used to alphabetize words in Python. The letters of the alphabet have numeric codes in Unicode (also known as ASCII values). The uppercase letters A to Z are represented by the Unicode values 65 to 90. The lowercase letters a to z are represented by the Unicode values 97 to 122. \n",

    "- To check if the first letter(s) of a string have a smaller Unicode value (meaning the letter is closer to 65 or uppercase A) than the first letter of another string, use the less than operator: `<`\n",
    "\n",
    "Like numeric comparisons with the greater than `>` and less than `<` operators, comparisons between strings also return Boolean `True` or `False` results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher Unicode value than the right string. If true, the Python interpreter returns a True result. Since W has a Unicode value of 87, and you can easily calculate that F has a Unicode value of 70, this comparison is the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True result.\n",
    "print(\"Wednesday\" > \"Friday\") # True\n",
    "  \n",
    "# The less than < operator checks if the left string has a lower Unicode value than the right string. If you reference the Unicode chart above, you can see that all lowercase letters have higher Unicode values than uppercase letters. We can see that B has a Unicode value of 66 and b has a Unicode value of 98. This comparison is the same as 66 < 98, which is true. So, Python will return a True result.\n",
    "print(\"Brown\" < \"brown\") # True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the strings have the same first few letters, the comparison will cycle through each letter of each string, from left to right until it finds 2 letters that have different Unicode values. In this example, both strings share the initial substring \"sun\", but then have different letters with different Unicode values in the fourth place in each string. So, the fourth letters 'b' and 't' of the 2 strings are used for the comparison. Since 'b' does not have a higher Unicode value than 't', the comparison returns a False result.\n",

    "#### 02.03.05 Reading: Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are used to construct more complex expressions. You can make complex comparisons by joining comparison statements together using the logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`. Complex comparisons return a Boolean (`True` or `False`) result. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `and`\n",
    "  - Both sides of the statement being evaluated must be True for the whole statement to be True. \n",
    "  - Example: `(5 > 1 and 5 < 10)` = `True`\n",
    "- `or`\n",
    "  - If either side of the comparison is True, then the whole statement is True. \n",
    "  - Example: `(color = \"blue\" or color = \"green\")` = `True`\n",
    "- `not`\n",
    "  - Inverts the Boolean result of the statement immediately following it. So, if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False. \n",
    "  - Example: `(not \"A\" == \"A\")` = `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PART 1: The `and` Logical Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the logical operator `and` to connect more than one comparison. This type of complex comparison is used to check if two comparison statements are both True or not. You might use the `and` operator when you need to execute a block of code, but only if two different conditions are true. For example, you might want to write a script  that automates sending you an emergency alert if a server stops responding and there is an unusual increase in employees opening trouble tickets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following model demonstrates the use of the `and` logical operator to join comparisons between two mathematical expressions. The description below the example explains the order in which Python will process the line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print((6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the following activities were completed by Python in the following order:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python solves the numerical expressions using the order of operations. `(6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2)` becomes `(18 >= 18)` and `(18 <= 18)`\n",
    "2. Python compares the results of the numerical expressions using the comparison operators (in this case `>=` and `<=`). `(18 >= 18) and (18 <= 18)` becomes `True` and `True`\n",
    "3. Python checks if both sides of the logical operator `and` are true. `True` and `True` become `True`\n",
    "4. Python returns a Boolean value: `True` or `False`. The complex comparison returns a `True` result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next example, `\"Nairobi\" < \"Milan\" and \"Nairobi\" > \"Hanoi\"`, the `and` logical operator is connecting 2 string comparison statements. You learned previously that using the greater than and less than operators on strings will test the alphabetical order (technically Unicode values) of the strings. So, this complex comparison is checking if `\"Nairobi\"` is alphabetized before `\"Milan\"` (`False`) AND after `\"Hanoi\"` (`True`). \n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison returns a False result because both sides of the logical operator are not True. A comparison statement like this might be used to iterate through a list of names to check if they are alphabetized in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Nairobi\" < \"Milan\" and \"Nairobi\" > \"Hanoi\")\n",

    "today = \"Monday\"\n",
    "print(not today == \"Tuesday\") \n",
    "# The \"today\" variable states today is Monday. This makes the comparison \"today == Tuesday\" False. The logical operator \"not\" inverts the False result to become True.

    "\n",
    "##### `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop executes the body of the loop while a specified condition remains `True`. They are commonly used when there’s an unknown number of operations to be performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while specified condition is True:\n",
    "    body of loop \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "multiplier = 1\n",
    "result = multiplier * 5\n",
    "while result <= 50:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "    multiplier += 1\n",
    "    result = multiplier * 5\n",
    "print(\"Done\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This while loop prints the multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. The \"multiplier\" variable is initialized with the starting value of 1. The \"result\" variable is initialized with the value of the \"multiplier\" variable times 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop specifies that the loop must iterate while it is True that the \"result\" is less than or equal to 50. Within the while loop, the code tells the Python interpreter to print the value of the \"result\" variable. Then, the \"multiplier\" is incremented by 1 and the \"result\" is assigned the new value of the \"multiplier\" times 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The end of the while loop is indicated by the indentation of the next line of code moving one tab to the left. At this point, the Python interpreter automatically loops back to the beginning of the while loop to check the condition again with the new value of the \"result\" variable. When the while loop condition becomes False (meaning \"result\" is no longer less than or equal to 50), the interpreter exits the loop and reads the next line of code outside of the loop. In this case, that next line tells the interpreter to print the string \"Done\". \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common Errors in Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error message on a loop or it appears to hang, your debugging checklist should include the following checks:\n",
    "- Failure to initialize variables - make sure all the variables used in the loop’s condition are initialized before the loop.\n",
    "- Unintended infinite loops - make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables. You can often prevent an infinite loop by using the break keyword or by adding end criteria to the condition part of the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***while***: A `while` loop tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is true. In other words, `while` loops keep executing the same group of instructions until the condition becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Infinite loop***: Missing a method for exiting the loop causes the loop to run forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***break***: A `break` statement in Python provides a way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false. Once a `break` statement is encountered, the program's control flow jumps out of the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***pass***: A `pass` statement in Python is a placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement without executing any code or command.\n",

    "  - E.g., The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. Each of these prime numbers can be evenly divided only by itself and 1. \n",
    "- > ***Prime factors***: Prime numbers that are factors of an integer.\n",
    "  - E.g., Prime numbers 2 and 5 are the prime factors of the number 10 (2x5=10). The prime factors of an integer will not produce a remainder when used to divide that integer. \n",
    "- > ***Divisor***: A number (denominator) that is used to divide another number (numerator). \n",
    "  - E.g., If the number 10 is divided by 5, the number 5 is the divisor.\n",
    "- > ***Sum of all divisors of a number***: The result of adding all of the divisors of a number together.  \n",

    "#### 03.02.05 Reading: A Closer Look at the `Range()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `in` keyword, when used with the `range()` function, generates a sequence of integer numbers, which can be used with a `for` loop to control the start point, the end point, and the incremental values of the loop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for n in range(x, y, z):\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function uses a set of indices that point to integer values, which start at the number 0. The numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correlate to ordinal index positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. So, when a range call to the 5th index position is made using `range(5)` the index is pointing to the numeric value of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index Number | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th |\n",
    "|:------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "| Value        | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function can take up to three parameters: `range(start, stop, step)`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Start\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item in the `range()` function parameters is the starting position of the range. The default is the first index position, which points to the numeric value 0. This value is included in the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stop\n",
    "\n",
    "The second item in the `range()` function parameters is the ending position of the range. There is no default index position, so this index number must be given to the `range()` parameters. For example, the line `for n in range(4)` will loop 4 times with the `n` variable starting at 0 and looping 4 index positions: 0, 1, 2, 3. As you can see, `range(4)` (meaning index position 4) ends at the numeric value 3. In Python, this structure may be phrased as “the end-of-range value is excluded from the range.” In order to include the value 4 in `range(4)`, the syntax can be written as `range(4+1)` or `range(5)`. Both of these ranges will produce the numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The third item in the `range()` function parameters is the incremental step value. The default increment is +1. The default value can be overridden with any valid increment. However, note that the loop will still end at the end-of-range index position, regardless of the incremental value. For example, if you have a loop with the range: `for n in range(1, 5, 6)`, the range will only produce the numeric value 1. This is because the incremental value of 6 exceeded the ending point of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Practice Exercise\n",

    "You can use the code block below to test the values of `n` with various `range()` parameters. A few suggestions to test are:\n",

    "\n",
    "Over the past few modules we’ve been talking about using loops and their syntax in Python. As you have seen, a loop is an instruction that repeats multiple times as long as the condition set forth in the loop is met. You use loops to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to send users an invitation, asking them to subscribe every time they open a new project, you would use a loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn the basics about for loops and how you can use them with strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For Loop Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, `for` loops enable you to iterate over a sequence of values, such as numbers, names, or lines in a file. You can even iterate over a list of strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are Strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this course we identified strings as one of the basic data types used by Python and other programming languages. Strings represent a sequence of characters and are often used to display output to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can recognize a string because it’s surrounded by single or double quotes like the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hello world.\"\n",
    "‘Ostriches can’t fly.’\n",
    "\"567.89\" \n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: You can’t mix single and double quotes in the same string or you’ll get a syntax error. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In the examples above, Python does not consider “567.89” a number. It is a string because it is surrounded by quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using For Loops with Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier video, you learned that a for loop iterates over the items in a collection until each item in the collection has been looped over. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: Every for loop can also be written as a while loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see what that looks like. In the example below, we’re using a for loop to print out the characters in the string “Hello.”\n",

    "The next character is: o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power of `for` loops is that they allow you to repeat sequences of any kind of data, not just a range of numbers or letters. They can help you find and use data faster. Over the next several videos and readings, you’ll get a chance to see what else you can do with loops and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 03.02.09 Reading: Looping Over a String\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping over a string allows programmers to examine each character within a string individually, gather information about its occurrences, and perform a given operation. There are multiple ways to loop over a string—some ways are more beneficial than others—and which one you choose depends on the information you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn about looping over a string, how to do it, and see some examples along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To loop over a string means to start with the first character in a string and iterate over each character until the end of the string. Strings are objects that contain a sequence of single-character strings. Yes, a single letter is classified as a string in Python. For example, `string[0]` is considered a string even though it is just a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Python does not use characters as a type like other programming languages do; it just supports strings with a length of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct—and common—way to loop over a string is to use the `for` loop. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "for char in greeting:\n",
    "\tprint(char)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `greeting` is defined as the string `'Hello'`. The loop begins with `char = 0`, which is the first element in the string. It directly calls the elements of the string and prints each element on a new line, resulting in the output below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "H\n",
    "e \n",
    "l \n",
    "l \n",
    "o \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you don’t want the elements of the string but the position of the string instead? You’re in luck because Python can work that magic too!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(len(greeting)):\n",
    "\tprint(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`len(greeting)` is an integer that tells Python how many characters are in the string. But because it’s an integer, you need to convert it to an iterable sequence by using the `range()` function. This loop does the same thing as the loop above, but instead of printing elements, it prints integers resulting in the output below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `while` Loop with Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "This `while` loop is the more “common” `while` loop that programmers often use. This type of loop involves an index variable to represent the current position within the sequence. Most of the time, this will start with 0 for the initial iteration. Let’s take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(greeting):\n",
    "\tprint(greeting[index])\n",
    "\tindex += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial index value is 0, and the `while` loop continues to execute as long as the index variable is less than the length of the `len(greeting)`. At each iteration, Python prints the value at the current index position `(greeting[index])`. Then, Python increments the index by 1 `(index += 1)` to move to the next position. The output of this example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "H\n",
    "e\n",
    "l \n",
    "l\n",
    "o \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro Tip: In any while loop, you can add conditional statements and stop the iteration process early so that the loop does not examine every character.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `while` Loop with Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a `while` loop with slicing accomplishes the same thing that a `while` loop with indexing does—like the example you explored above—this is just another way to write a `while` loop. You use this `while` loop in combination with string slicing to iterate over a portion of a sequence. Remember, it’s up to you to choose the method for looping over a string based on your level of comfort. There are multiple ways to write lines of code to execute the same result. Let’s explore how a `while` loop with slicing results in the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(greeting):\n",
    "    print(greeting[index:index+1])\n",
    "    index += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `while` loop continues to run as long as the index variable is less than the length of the string, which is determined by using `len(greeting)`. With each iteration, a substring of length 1 is extracted using `(greeting[index:index+1])` and printed. Then, the index is incremented by 1 `(index += 1)` to move to the next position. The output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "H\n",
    "e\n",
    "l \n",
    "l \n",
    "o \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "print(squared_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example starts with a list of numbers. The second line of code defines the type of transformation you want to execute on each element in the original list. In this case, you’re using this line of code to create a new list called `squared_numbers` and apply `x ** 2` to square each element in the `numbers` list. The result of each squared element is then printed in a new list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: List comprehensions can include conditional statements and nested loops, which allows for additional filtering of elements based on specific called conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Advanced String Loop Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional ways to loop over a string in Python that you should learn, practice, and master. These additional looping techniques include the generator functions, `map()`, and `zip()`. The `map()` and `zip()` functions are extremely powerful string manipulation tools that demonstrate functional programming concepts. To learn more about these advanced techniques, see these resources:\n",
    "- [Python map() Function](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-map-function)\n",
    "- [Python zip() Method](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/zip-method)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro Tip:  Looping over multiple strings at once can push the limits of `for` loops. Because of this, it’s important to be aware of other alternatives to simplify a `for` or `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "When you loop over a string, you are able to examine each individual element in the string and manipulate it how you’d like. A `for` loop iterates over each element, and a `while` loop allows you to add conditional statements and stop the iteration process early. As you saw in this reading, there are a variety of methods to loop over a string. It’s up to you to familiarize yourself with each technique and write code according to the advantages and disadvantages of each.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 03.02.10 Reading: Slice and Join Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been learning all about strings. Now it’s time to learn how to extract parts of a string—what we call “slicing” a string—or create a longer string by joining two or more strings together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing a string is just like taking a slice out of a homemade apple pie. When it comes to strings, slices can be as small or as big as you want. If you want to put two or more of those slices back together, you join them together end-to-end—in Python speak, you “concatenate” them—to make one bigger, single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn when to slice and join strings, how to do it, and see some examples along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is Slicing and Joining Strings?  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you slice a string, you extract a subset of the original string—sometimes referred to as indexing a string. Joining strings is the process of linking two or more strings together to create a bigger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Slice Strings \n",
    "\n",
    "Bracket notation, `[ ]`, is used to specify the start of the index, ending index, or both. If you do not include the starting index, then the slice contains everything from the beginning of the string to the ending index. This is the same if you do not include the ending index. Let’s look at a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: Remember that the indexes in Python start with 0, and not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string1 = \"Greetings, Earthlings\"\n",
    "print(string1[0])   # Prints “G”\n",
    "print(string1[4:8]) # Prints “ting”\n",
    "print(string1[11:]) # Prints “Earthlings”\n",
    "print(string1[:5])  # Prints “Greet”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: When you specify an ending index, Python slices everything up to, but not including the ending index. Notice in the second example the ending index is 8, but the characters sliced are 4–7.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your index is negative, Python counts back from the end of the string instead of the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(string1[-10:])     # Prints “Earthlings” again\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your index is beyond the end of the string, Python returns an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(string1[55:])     # Prints “” \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional way to slice an index is by the stride argument, indicated by using a double colon. This allows you to skip over the corresponding number of characters in your index, or if you’re using a negative stride, the string prints backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(string1[0::2])    # Prints “Getns atlns”\n",
    "print(string1[::-1])    # Prints “sgnilhtraE ,sgniteerG”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Join Strings \n",
    "\n",
    "To join strings in Python, you use the plus operator, + , just as if you were adding two numbers together. The following example joins three strings together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"world\") #Prints “Hello world”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `join()` function, which is very useful when you want to concatenate elements from a list of strings with a specific delimiter. In the following example, we have a list of strings called greetings and we join them with a space using `.join(greetings)`. The `join()` function concatenates all the strings in the list greetings, and places a space between each string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greetings = [\"Hello\", \"world\"]\n",
    "print(\" \".join(greetings))  # Prints \"Hello world\"\n",
    "You can also concatenate a combination of strings and variables like in the following example.\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")  # Prints \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Combine Slicing and Joining Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how to slice strings and join strings. Now, let’s put the two operations together by taking an unformatted phone number, 2025551212, and return it as a properly formatted U.S. number. In this example, we’ll use `phonenum` to refer to the unformatted phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The first 3 digits are the area code:\n",
    "\tarea_code = \"(\" + phonenum[:3] + \")\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function slices the first three numbers from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The next 3 digits are called the “exchange”:\n",
    "\texchange = phonenum[3:6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function slices the numbers 4–6 from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The next 3 digits are the line number:\n",
    "\tline = phonenum[-4:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This negative index function counts backwards from the end of the numbers, slicing the last four numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Put the pieces back together into a nicely formatted string:\n",
    "\treturn area_code + \" \" + exchange + \"-\" + line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re done, your code will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def format_phone(phonenum):\n",
    "    area_code = \"(\" + phonenum[:3] + \")\"\n",
    "    exchange = phonenum[3:6]\n",
    "    line = phonenum[-4:]\n",
    "    return area_code + \" \" + exchange + \"-\" + line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll use the print function to join the three previously sliced numbers together in the correct format. With this function definition, when you call `print(format_phone(\"2025551212\"))`, it will print (202) 555-1212. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(format_phone(\"2025551212\")) # Outputs: (202) 555-1212\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing and joining strings can be beneficial to correctly format numbers, making it easier to manipulate data in a more efficient and meaningful way. Slicing strings allows you to access individual characters of a string by specifying the index. The index can be as long or as short as you like—you can even have a negative index, if counting backwards is your thing! Joining strings allows you to add two or more strings together, which is beneficial when needing to create a sentence or even properly format different numbers.\n",

    "##### `for` Loops vs. `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops and `while` loops share several characteristics. Both loops can be used with a variety of data types, both can be nested, and both can be used with the keywords break and continue. However, there are important differences between the two types of loops: \n",
    "- `while` loops are used when a segment of code needs to execute repeatedly while a condition is true\n",
    "- `for` loops iterate over a sequence of elements, executing the body of the loop for each element in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "An important distinction is that for loops are suited for objects that have iterable structures. So lists, strings, ranges of integers. Individual integers are not iterable, but can be looped over by the use of the range() function, which is covered below. While loops do not iterate per se, rather they watch a truth condition \n",

    "`for` Loop with `range()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The in keyword with the `range()` function generates a sequence of integer numbers, which can be used with a `for` loop to configure the iterations of the code. The range of numbers [0, 1, 2] correlates to ordinal index positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd), rather than the cardinal (quantity) values of the numbers 0, 1, and 2. For example, range(5) means the five index positions in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function can take up to three parameters. The roles of the three possible `range(x,y,z)` parameters are:\n",
    "- `x = Start` - Starting index position of the range \n",
    "  - Default index position is 0.\n",
    "  - The starting index position is included in the range.\n",
    "  - Example syntax: `range(2, y, z)` or `range(x+3, y, z)` \n",
    "- `y = Stop` - Ending index position of range\n",
    "  - No default index position. Must include the ending index position in the `range()` parameters.\n",
    "  - Example syntax: `range(y)`\n",
    "  - The value of the ending index position is excluded from the range.\n",
    "  - To include the ending index number, use the expression: `y+1` (index + 1)\n",

The concepts for loops are similar between other languages, but in Python, list comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or sequences. \n",

    "String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an `IndexError`. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access a portion of a string, called a slice or a substring. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like `[2:5]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we aren't sure what the index of our typo is, we can use the string method index to locate it and return the index. Let's imagine we have the string `\"lions tigers and bears\"` in the variable `animals`. We can locate the index that contains the letter `g` using animals.index(\"g\"), which will return the index; in this case 8. We can also use substrings to locate the index where the substring begins. animals.index(\"bears\") would return 17, since that’s the start of the substring. If there’s more than one match for a substring, the index method will return the first match. If we try to locate a substring that doesn't exist in the string, we’ll receive a `ValueError` explaining that the substring was not found.\n",

In this case, it's a conditional that will be either True or False. If the substring is found in the string, it will be True. If the substring is not found in the string, it will be False. Using our previous variable `animals`, we can do `\"horses\" in animals` to check if the substring \"horses\" is found in our variable. In this case, it would evaluate to False, since horses aren’t included in our example string. If we did `\"tigers\" in animals`, we'd get True, since this substring is contained in our string.\n",

    "\n",
    "We've covered a bunch of String class methods already, so let's keep building on those and run down some more advanced methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string method `lower()` will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the `upper()` method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like `\"this is a string\".upper()`. This would return the string `\"THIS IS A STRING\"`. This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `strip()` method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `count()` can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method `endswith()`. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `isnumeric()` method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the `int()` function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the `join()` method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, `\" \".join([\"This\",\"is\",\"a\",\"sentence\"])` would return the string `\"This is a sentence\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of the join method is the `split()` method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter.\n",

    "  - `\"xxx{}xxx{}xxx\".format(\"name\", number)` can take variables holding a string and a number without conversion.\n",
    "  - When we use placeholders with variable names `\"{var1}xxx{var2}\"`, the order in which variables are passed to `format()` doesn't matter.\n",
    "    - e.g., `print(\"Your lucky number is {number}, {name}.\".format(name=name, number=len(name)*3))`\n",

    "#### 04.01.15 Reading: String Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `format()` method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, `{}`, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using `.format()` and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression `{:.2f}` means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: `>`. For example, the expression `{:>3.2f}` would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most programs eventually need to provide some kind of output or feedback to the user. Formatting the output makes it easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you are working in a farmer’s market and need to generate receipts for your customers. You need to weigh the items, calculate the total price for each item (weight times the price per pound), and then add sales tax to the subtotal. Your first attempt might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Here are the items in the customer's basket. Each item is a tuple of (item name, weight, price per pound).\n",
    "basket = [\n",
    "    (\"Peaches\", 3.0, 2.99),\n",

    "print(\"Subtotal:\", subtotal)\n",
    "print(\"Sales Tax:\", tax_amt)\n",
    "print(\"Total:\", total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the above code, you’ll notice the output looks a bit messy:\n",

    "Sales Tax: 1.8049812500000002 \n",
    "Total: 29.049981250000002\n",

    "Total:        $29.05\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to do this in Python is by formatting strings in your output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers different ways to format strings. In the Formatting Strings video, we explained the `format()` method. In this reading, we'll highlight three different ways of formatting strings. For this course you need to know only the `format()` method. But on the internet, you might find any of the three, so it's a good idea to know that the others exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using the `format()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `format()` method takes a string containing special placeholders, called the format string, and replaces the special placeholder characters `{}` with the value of the arguments you pass. The arguments are converted to strings if they weren’t already. The number of arguments you pass must exactly match the number of placeholders in the format string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit = \"peaches\"\n",
    "weight = 3.0\n",
    "per_pound = 2.99\n",
    "output = \"You are buying {} pounds of {} at {} per pound.\".format(weight, fruit, per_pound)\n",
    "print(output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are buying 3.0 pounds of peaches at 2.99 per pound.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also consume the arguments to `format()` in any order you want by specifying the index inside the placeholder. As with lists and arrays, the index always starts with 0. You can even use an index more than once. Here you can see we’re using the second argument twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = \"{1} are {2} per pound, and you have {0} pounds of {1}.\".format(weight, fruit, per_pound)\n",
    "print(output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Peaches are 2.99 per pound, and you have 3.0 pounds of peaches.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A third option for the placeholders is to use field names instead of indexes. This can make your code much more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = \"{fruit} are {price} per pound, and you have {weight} pounds of {fruit}.\".format(weight=weight, fruit=fruit, price=per_pound)\n",
    "print(output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Peaches are 2.99 per pound, and you have 3.0 pounds of peaches.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also gives you many options to control the appearance of the output. Remember the messy output from the first example? You can have Python automatically round things up to the nearest penny and produce nice output by using a formatting expression. In the example below, the code tells Python to round up the numbers to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Print the receipt for the customer. The format string \":10,.2f\" \n",
    "# works as follows:\n",
    "#   - \":10\" makes the output 10 characters wide.\n",
    "#   - \",\" inserts thousands separators between groups of digits.\n",
    "#   - \".2\" limits the output to two digits after the decimal.\n",
    "#   - \"f\" tells Python to expect a floating-point number.\n",
    "#\n",
    "print(\"Subtotal:     ${:10,.2f}\".format(subtotal))\n",
    "print(\"Sales Tax:    ${:10,.2f}\".format(tax_amt))\n",
    "print(\"Total:        ${:10,.2f}\".format(total))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Subtotal:     $    27.25 \n",
    "Sales Tax:    $     1.80 \n",
    "Total:        $    29.05\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything inside the placeholder after the “`:`” colon is part of the formatting expression. The expression “`:10,.2f`” means “make the output 10 characters wide, use digit separators if the amount is over 1000, output no more than 2 digits after the decimal, and expect the input to be a floating-point decimal number”. \n",

    "- We can think of lists as long boxes with the space inside divided up into different slots. Each slot can contain a different value.\n",
    "- Python uses `[]` to represent a list.\n",
    "- String and list are both examples of sequences. They share similar operations: \n",
    "  - Iterating over them using `for` loops\n",
    "    - `for element in sequence`\n",
    "  - Indexing \n",
    "    - `sequence[i]`\n",
    "  - Using `len()` to know the sequence length\n",
    "    - `len(sequence)`\n",
    "  - Using `+` to concatenate 2 sequences\n",
    "    - `sequence + sequence` \n",
    "  - Using `in` to verify if the sequence contains the element \n",
    "    - `element in sequence`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 04.02.03 Reading: Lists Defined\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: `my_list = [\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"]`. You can use the `len()` function to return the number of elements in a list: `len(my_list)` would return 4. You can also use the in keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. For example, `\"This\" in my_list` would return True in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing `my_list[0]`, which would allow you to access the string `\"This\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists and strings are quite similar. They’re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, like (1) being able to iterate over them using `for` loops; (2) support indexing; (3) using the `len()` function to find the length of the sequence; (4) using the plus operator `+` in order to concatenate; and (5) using the `in` keyword to check if the sequence contains a value. Understanding these concepts allows you to apply them to other sequence types as well.\n",

    "- The order of the elements inside the tuple matters. \n",

    "#### 04.02.08 Reading: Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, strings and lists are both examples of sequences. Strings are sequences of characters, and are immutable. Lists are sequences of elements of any data type, and are mutable. The third sequence type is the tuple. Tuples are like lists, since they can contain elements of any data type. But unlike lists, tuples are immutable. They’re specified using parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why tuples are a thing, given how similar they are to lists. Tuples can be useful when we need to ensure that an element is in a certain position and will not change. Since lists are mutable, the order of the elements can be changed on us. Since the order of the elements in a tuple can't be changed, the position of the element in a tuple can have meaning. A good example of this is when a function returns multiple values. In this case, what gets returned is a tuple, with the return values as elements in the tuple. The order of the returned values is important, and a tuple ensures that the order isn’t going to change. Storing the elements of a tuple in separate variables is called unpacking. This allows you to take multiple returned values from a function and store each value in its own variable.\n",

    "You can create a list from an iterable using a for loop, which is a useful way to iterate over an iterable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = []\n",
    "for thing in list_of_things:\n",
    "    new_list.append(do_something(thing))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a more streamlined way to do this by using a list comprehension. A list comprehension allows you to create a new list from an iterable in a single line. This line achieves the same result as the previous for loop, but in a more concise way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_list = [do_something(thing) for thing in list_of_things]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can be used with tuples in Python, too. Here is an example of a list of tuples. In this example each tuple will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 3. This code will create 5 sets of (1,2,3).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "numbers = [(1, 2, 3) for _ in range(5)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For Loop vs. List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "The two code blocks below compare performing the same process using a list comprehension and a `for` loop. The line `[x*2 for x in range(1,11)]` is a simple list comprehension. This single line of code iterates over a range from 1 to 10, multiplies each element in the range by 2, and ultimately creates a new list from all multiples of 2 from 2 to 20. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second block of code below is a for loop designed to carry out the same function as the list comprehension. The `for` loop, however, requires 3 lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "### Simple List Comprehension\n",
    "print(\"List comprehension result:\")\n",
    "# The following list comprehension compacts several lines \n",
    "# of code into one line:\n",
    "print([x*2 for x in range(1,11)])\n",
    "### Long form for loop\n",
    "print(\"Long form code result:\")\n",
    "# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as\n",
    "# the long form version of the code shown below:\n",

    "for x in range(1,11):\n",
    "    my_list.append(x*2)\n",
    "print(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### List Comprehension with Conditional Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use conditionals with list comprehensions to build even more complex and powerful statements. You can do this by appending an `if` statement to the end of the list comprehension. For example, `[x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0]` generates a new list containing all the integers divisible by 10 from 1 to 100. The `if` statement evaluates each value in the range from 1 to 100 to check if it’s evenly divisible by 10. If it is, the number is added to a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"List comprehension result:\")\n",
    "print([x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0])\n",
    "# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as\n",

    "    if x % 10 == 0:\n",
    "        my_list.append(x)\n",
    "print(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can be really powerful, but they can also be complex, resulting in code that’s hard to read. Be careful when using them, because they might make it more difficult for someone else looking at your code to easily understand what the code is doing. It is a best practice to add descriptive comments about any list comprehensions used in your code. This helps to communicate the purpose of list comprehensions to other coders. Comments will also help you remember the goal of the code when performing future code additions and maintenance. \n",

    "This exercise walks you through how to write a list comprehension to create a list of squared numbers (n*n or n**2). It needs to return a list of squares of consecutive numbers between “start” and “end” inclusively. For example, squares(2, 3) should return a list containing [4, 9].\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function receives the variables “start” and “end” through the function parameters. \n",
    "2. In the return line, start by entering the list brackets [ ] that will contain the list comprehension.\n",

    "   a. Enter the arithmetic expression to square a variable “n”. \n",
    "   b. To the right of the square expression, write a for loop that iterates over “n” in a range() from the “start” to “end” variables.\n",
    "   c. Ensure the “end” range value is included in the range() by adding 1 to it.\n",
    "4. Run your code to see if it works!  If needed, the solution to this code is included in the “Study Guide: List Operations and Methods” reading under “Skill Group 2” (list comprehensions). \n",

    "#### 04.02.16 Reading: Study Guide: List Operations and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Lists and Tuples video, you learned about the differences between lists and tuples, how to modify the contents of a list, how to iterate over lists and tuples, how to use the enumerate() function, and how to create list comprehensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common Sequence Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and tuples are both sequences and they share a number of sequence operations. The following common sequence operations are used by both lists and tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `len(sequence)` - Returns the length of the sequence.\n",
    "- `for element in sequence` - Iterates over each element in the sequence.\n",
    "- `if element in sequence` - Checks whether the element is part of the sequence.\n",
    "- `sequence[x]` - Accesses the element at index [x] of the sequence, starting at zero\n",
    "- `sequence[x:y]` - Accesses a slice starting at index [x], ending at index [y-1]. If [x] is omitted, the index will start at 0 by default. If [y] is omitted, the len(sequence) will set the ending index position by default.\n",
    "- `for index, element in enumerate(sequence)` - Iterates over both the indices and the elements in the sequence at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because integers are not iterable, they need to be converted to a range as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in range(len(someList)):\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "# this will print out a numerical value up to the length of the original string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### List-specific Operations and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "One major difference between lists and tuples is that lists are mutable (changeable) and tuples are immutable (not changeable). There are a few operations and methods that are specific to changing data within lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `list[index] = x` - Replaces the element at index [n] with x.\n",
    "- `list.append(x)` - Appends x to the end of the list.\n",
    "- `list.insert(index, x)` - Inserts x at index position [index].\n",
    "- `list.pop(index)` - Returns the element at [index] and removes it from the list. If [index] position is not in the list, the last element in the list is returned and removed.\n",
    "- `list.remove(x)` - Removes the first occurrence of x in the list.\n",
    "- `list.sort()` - Sorts the items in the list.\n",
    "- `list.reverse()` - Reverses the order of items of the list.\n",
    "- `list.clear()` - Deletes all items in the list.\n",
    "- `list.copy()` - Creates a copy of the list.\n",
    "- `list.extend(other_list)` - Appends all the elements of other_list at the end of list\n",
    "- `map(function, iterable)` - Applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list) and returns a map object with the results\n",
    "- `zip(*iterables)` - Takes in iterables as arguments and returns an iterator that generates tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tuple Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, there are a number of cases where using a tuple might be more suitable than other data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Protecting data: Because tuples are immutable, they can be used in situations where you want to ensure the data you have cannot be changed. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with sensitive or important information that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program.\n",
    "- Hashable keys: Because they're immutable, tuples can be used as keys on dictionaries, which can be useful for complex keys.\n",
    "- Efficiency: Tuples are generally more memory-efficient than lists, making them advantageous when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The tuple() Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tuple()` operator is used to convert an iterable (like a list, string, or set) into a tuple. Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert a list to a tuple\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "my_tuple = tuple(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "# Remember that although parentheses are often used to define a tuple, \n",
    "# they're not always necessary. The following syntax is also valid:\n",
    "my_tuple = 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can sometimes lead to confusion, particularly when tuples are used in function calls or with operators that also use parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tuples with Mutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Although tuples themselves are immutable, they can contain mutable objects, such as lists. This means that although the tuple cannot be modified (for example, you can't add or remove elements), the mutable elements within the tuple can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A tuple with a list as an element\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c'])\n",
    "# You can't change the tuple itself\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 3  # This would raise a TypeError\n",
    "# But you can modify the mutable elements within the tuple\n",
    "my_tuple[2][0] = 'x'  \n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Outputs: (1, 2, ['x', 'b', 'c'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Returning Multiple Values from Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful aspects of tuples in Python is their ability to return multiple values from a function. This allows a function to produce more than one result, providing flexibility and improving code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = calculate_numbers(10, 2)\n",
    "print(result)  # Outputs: (12, 8, 20, 5.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above function, the four arithmetic calculations are returned as a tuple, which can be assigned to a single variable (result), or \"unpacked\" into multiple variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b\n",
    "\n",
    "add_result, sub_result, mul_result, div_result = calculate_numbers(10, 2)\n",
    "print(add_result)  # Outputs: 12\n",
    "print(sub_result)  # Outputs: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful feature that makes Python functions extremely versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension is an efficient method for creating a new list from a sequence or a range in a single line of code. It is a best practice to add descriptive comments about any list comprehensions used in your code, as their purpose can be difficult to interpret by other coders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[expression for variable in sequence]` - Creates a new list based on the given sequence. Each element in the new list is the result of the given expression.\n",
    "  - E.g., `my_list = [x*2 for x in range(1,11)]`\n",
    "- `[expression for variable in sequence if condition]` - Creates a new list based on a specified sequence. Each element is the result of the given expression; elements are added only if the specified condition is true. \n",
    "  - E.g., `my_list = [x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tuples do not have comprehensions but a similar functionality can be achieved with: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tuple(i for i in (1, 2, 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When to Use For Loops or List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, list comprehensions are generally used for creating new lists from existing ones in a concise and readable manner, especially when the task involves simple transformations or filtering of elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops are more versatile and are preferred when the operation is more complex, requires multiple lines of code, involves statements other than expression (like `print`, `pass`, `continue`, `break`), or when you need to iterate over a list without creating a new one.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Like lists, dictionaries are used to organize elements into collections. \n",
    "- Dictionaries vs. lists \n",
    "  - We don't access elements inside dictionaries using their position.\n",
    "  - List index must be a number.\n",
    "  - Dictionary keys can be different data types.\n",
    "- The data inside dictionaries take the form of pairs of keys and values. \n",
    "- To get a dictionary value, we use its corresponding key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 04.03.03 Reading: Dictionaries Defined\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are another data structure in Python. They’re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. However, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Data in a dictionary is organized into pairs of keys and values. You use the key to access the corresponding value. Where a list index is always a number, a dictionary key can be a different data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a dictionary, you use curly brackets: `{}`. When storing values in a dictionary, the key is specified first, followed by the corresponding value, separated by a colon. For example, `animals = { \"bears\":10, \"lions\":1, \"tigers\":2 }` creates a dictionary with three key value pairs, stored in the variable animals. The key \"bears\" points to the integer value 10, while the key \"lions\" points to the integer value 1, and \"tigers\" points to the integer 2. You can access the values by referencing the key, like this: `animals[\"bears\"]`. This would return the integer 10, since that’s the corresponding value for this key.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also check if a key is contained in a dictionary using the in keyword. Just like other uses of this keyword, it will return True if the key is found in the dictionary; otherwise it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be modified by adding, removing, and replacing elements in a dictionary, similar to lists. You can add a new key value pair to a dictionary by assigning a value to the key, like this: `animals[\"zebras\"] = 2`. This creates the new key in the animal dictionary called zebras, and stores the value 2. You can modify the value of an existing key by doing the same thing. So `animals[\"bears\"] = 11` would change the value stored in the bears key from 10 to 11. Lastly, you can remove elements from a dictionary by using the `del` keyword. By doing `del animals[\"lions\"]` you would remove the key value pair from the animals dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 04.03.06 Reading: Use While Loops and If-else Statements for Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve learned that `if` statements are used as a form of decision making. `if` statements tell your computer to perform a conditional execution based on the value of an expression. Using else in conjunction with an if statement allows your computer to evaluate for multiple conditions and run a statement if other conditions are false. In other words, `else` is the condition that runs if all other statements are not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve also learned that `while` loops instruct your computer to continuously execute your code based on the value of a condition, but it will only continue to execute as long as the evaluation statement is `True`. Once that statement is no longer `True`, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn about using `while` loops and if-else statements for dictionaries, and see examples demonstrating the benefits of using them in your Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### While Loops  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are used to organize elements into collections using pairs of keys and values. But what do you do when you need to search a collection of data for a value? That’s where `while` loops come in. A `while` loop will iterate through conditions until one comes up `False`, unlike a `for` loop, which will iterate through the entire dictionary, one row at a time. Consider the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for item in someDictionary:\n",
    "    <code goes here>\n",
    "```\n",
    "vs. \n",
    "```\n",
    "while someDictionary:\n",
    "    <code goes here>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the difference between the `for` loop and the `while` loop — unlike the `for` loop, the `while` loop does not require calling a variable to act as a counter, or the “item” variable in the `for` loop. `for` loops anticipate a specific structure—like a list—and when called, will iterate through the entire list, until it gets to the end. `while` loops can be used more universally when the structure of your data set is more ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If-else Statements \n",
    "\n",
    "if-else statements are useful if you want to find and check for specific values and perform specific actions based on the result. Consider the following example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if a key exists in the dictionary and perform different actions based on the result\n",
    "key = 'banana'\n",
    "if key in myDictionary:\n",
    "\tprint(f\"The value of {key} is {myDictionary[key]}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "\tprint(f\"{key} is not found in the dictionary\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to search if the key “banana” exists in the dictionary. The first line determines the key, “banana,” which is what we want to search for in the dictionary. The second line uses an `if` statement to search for the key within the dictionary and prints the value of that particular key if the condition is `True`. The `else` statement will return that the key was not found in the dictionary if the condition is `False`. As an example, this code block will return “The value of banana is 3” or “banana is not found in the dictionary” when it is run. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "`while` loops and `if else` statements are methods you can use to search for values within a dictionary. If you want to search through an entire dictionary quickly to find a value, use a `while` loop. If you want to search through a dictionary to find and check a value, use an if-else statement to return the value and perform specific actions based on the result. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 04.04.02 Reading: What Is a Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, methods are behaviors associated with object parameters that modify the state of that object. They are essentially functions that belong to a specific instance of a class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of the list, and not all lists globally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods in Python fall into several categories: \n",
    "- Instance methods\n",
    "- Class methods\n",
    "- Static methods\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python. You define instance methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. When you instantiate instances of a class, those individual instances can have their methods called so the program can control and modify those instances directly. Instance methods can take a parameter called `self`, which represents the instance the method is being executed on, that allows you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like `self.name`, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods, on the other hand, are called for the class itself instead of an instance. They are marked with a `@classmethod` decorator and take a `cls` parameter that points to the class—and not any specific instance—when the method is called. One common use-case for class methods is to create and modify data structures that contain records for all instances of a class. Usually, programmers make a list inside the class definition, and methods to add instances of the class to that list in order to keep track of that class. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Static Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, static methods, marked with a `@staticmethod` decorator, do not take a self or a `cls` parameter. Static methods behave like plain functions, except that you can call them directly from the class. It is important to note that you do not have to actually instantiate the class, the methods just reside in there. This is because class definitions are themselves an object (i.e., an instance of abstract base class), which reduces overhead and allows functions to be encapsulated in an easy-to-use encapsulation. Programmers use static methods when the method does not need to access any instance or class-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choosing a Method Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of method you choose to use—instance, class, or static—depends on what data the method needs to access. Think of these methods as different tools in your toolbox, each with a different use-case depending on the data you need to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance methods are for individual object data\n",
    "- Class methods for shared data,Static methods for related tasks that don't need to access or modify any object or class data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, methods in Python are a way to bundle behavior with objects, allowing you to interact with and modify the state of those objects. However, static methods offer a way to bundle functions together, to be used in general on any other type of object. Bundling functions together helps organize functions in a clean manner and helps package them for reuse in other coding projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 04.04.03 Reading: Constructors and Other Special Methods (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have been learning, you can use a class in Python to bundle data and functionality together. When you create a new class, you create a new type of object. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating an Instance of a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you create an instance of a class, Python calls a special class method the constructor. The constructor’s job is to set up the object, meaning that instance of the class, so it’s ready to be used. Usually this means initializing some variables and doing other simple housekeeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a Python class, you define a method called `__init__` to be your constructor. The special name tells Python to use that method as the constructor. Just like any other method, the constructor can take arguments. When making an argument to the class, the first constructor must always be `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example of a constructor that initializes an object’s variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Apple:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.color = \"red\"\n",
    "        self.flavor = \"sweet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "honeycrisp = Apple()\n",
    "print(honeycrisp.color)\n",
    "# prints \"red\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Modify Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to make our Apple class more flexible, we could allow the user to specify the color and flavor as arguments when creating the object. We can modify our constructor to take those arguments and use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Apple:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, flavor):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.flavor = flavor\n",
    "\n",
    "honeycrisp = Apple(\"red\", \"sweet\")\n",
    "fuji = Apple(\"red\", \"tart\")\n",
    "print(honeycrisp.flavor)\n",
    "print(fuji.flavor)\n",
    "# prints \"sweet\" and \"tart\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Other Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, Python classes have many other special methods. Most of these have default implementations provided by the Python standard library, but you are free to override the behavior of any of them. Like the `__init__` constructor, special methods begin and end with a double underscore, and this is called \"dunder method\". The word “dunder” combines the “d” in double and the “under” in underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `__str__` special method controls how your object is converted to a string representation for output. When you `print()` something, Python calls the object’s `__str__()` method and outputs whatever that method returns. In most cases, the default output is just the class name and a memory location:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    ">>> print(honeycrisp)\n",
    "<__main__.Apple object at 0x7ffa68d78970>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s override the `__str__` method to be more useful for apples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Apple:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, flavor):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.flavor = flavor\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return \"an apple which is {} and {}\".format(self.color, self.flavor)\n",
    "\n",
    "honeycrisp = Apple(\"red\", \"sweet\")\n",
    "print(honeycrisp)\n",
    "# prints \"an apple which is red and sweet\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the other special methods you can override in your own classes:\n",
    "- `__len__` returns the length of the object or collection.\n",
    "- `__contains__` tests whether the object contains an item.\n",
    "- `__eq__` tests whether two objects are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor (such as `__init__`) is a special class method that sets up the object in Python. When making an argument to a class, the first constructor must always be `self`. Python classes have many special methods available in the standard library. These methods can be overridden using the method called \"dunder method\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 04.04.04 Reading: Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating classes with empty or default values, we can set these values when we create the instance. This ensures that we don't miss an important value and avoids a lot of unnecessary lines of code. To do this, we use a special method called a constructor. Below is an example of an Apple class with a \"constructor\" method defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Apple:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, flavor):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.flavor = flavor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the name of a class, the constructor of that class is called. This constructor method is always named `__init__`. You might remember that special methods start and end with two underscore characters. In our example above, the constructor method takes the self variable, which represents the instance, as well as color and flavor parameters. These parameters are then used by the constructor method to set the values for the current instance. So we can now create a new instance of the Apple class and set the color and flavor values all in go:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "jonagold = Apple(\"red\", \"sweet\")\n",
    "print(jonagold.color)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `__init__` constructor special method, there is also the `__str__` special method. This method allows us to define how an instance of an object will be printed when it’s passed to the `print()` function. If an object doesn’t have this special method defined, it will wind up using the default representation, which will print the position of the object in memory. Not super useful. Here is our Apple class, with the `__str__` method added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Apple:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, flavor):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.flavor = flavor\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return \"This apple is {} and its flavor is {}\".format(self.color, self.flavor)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we pass an Apple object to the print function, we get a nice formatted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "jonagold = Apple(\"red\", \"sweet\")\n",
    "print(jonagold)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This apple is red and its flavor is sweet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to think about how your class might be used and to define a `__str__` method when creating objects that you may want to print later.\n",

    "#### 04.04.06 Reading: Methods as Special Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already learned about methods and how they are just functions that belong to a class. They define the behavior that an object of the class can perform. Special operators are specific symbols or keywords that are built-in and provide special behavior when used with certain data types or objects. In your class, you can define methods to implement or override the standard behavior of Python operators, thus creating methods as special operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading you will learn about the different types of special operators, how to override the standard operators and embed them in your code, and see examples along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Different Types of Special Operators  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a variety of different operators that you can use in your code to make life easier for you. Some of the more common operators are:\n",
    "- Arithmetic operators: \n",
    "  - `+` (addition)\n",
    "  - `-` (subtraction)\n",
    "  - `*` (multiplication)\n",
    "  - `/` (division)\n",
    "  - `**` (exponentiation)\n",
    "- Comparison operators: \n",
    "  - `==` (equality)\n",
    "  - `!=` (inequality)\n",
    "  - `<` (less than)\n",
    "  - `>=` (greater than or equal to)\n",
    "- Logical operators\n",
    "- `and`\n",
    "- `or`\n",
    "- `not`\n",
    "- Assignment operators\n",

    "- `+=` (addition assignment)\n",
    "- `%=` (modulo assignment)\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Performing Special Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Every special operator has a corresponding \"dunder\" method that implements the operation. In Python, you denote a dunder method by placing double underscores at the beginning and end of the name; in fact, the term “dunder” comes from this use of double underscores. You can change how an operator behaves with an instance of your object by overriding the implementation. Let’s look at an example:\n",

    "#### 04.04.07 Reading: Study Guide: Classes and Methods (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few videos, we’ve seen how to define classes and methods in Python. Here, you’ll find a run-down of everything we’ve covered, so you can refer to it whenever you need a refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining Classes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def method_name(self, other_parameters):\n",
    "        body_of_method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classes and Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes define the behavior of all instances of a specific class. In Python, the code defining a class is, itself, an object; classes can be used without instantiating a single object, such as when using static methods\n",
    "- Remember, each variable of a specific class is an instance or object.\n",
    "- In Python, \"getters and setters\" are methods used for controlling access to an object's attributes. The getter method retrieves the value of an attribute, while the setter method sets or changes the attribute's value, often including some sort of validation or modification to the data before setting the value.\n",
    "- You can access an instance's attribute, like `name`, by calling self.name within the class methods, or `<instance>.name` outside the class, where `<instance>` is the specific instance of the class you're working with.Objects can have attributes, which store information about the object.\n",
    "- You can make objects do work by calling their methods.\n",
    "- The first parameter of the methods, `(self)`, represents the current instance.\n",
    "- Methods are just like functions, but they can only be used through a class.\n",
    "- You can use class methods in conjunction with a class variable to track the number of instances of a class, incrementing the class variable each time an instance is created in the class's `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Special methods start and end with `__`.\n",
    "- Special methods have specific names, like `__init__` for the constructor or `__str__` for the conversion to string.\n",
    "- The methods `__str__` and `__repr__` allow you to define human-readable and unambiguous string representations of your objects, respectively.\n",
    "- By defining methods like `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, and `__ge__`, you can control how objects of your class are compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documenting Classes, Methods, and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add documentation to classes, methods, and functions by using \"docstrings\" right after the definition. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Documentation for the class.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def method_name(self, other_parameters):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Documentation for the method.\"\"\"\n",
    "        body_of_method\n",
    "        \n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Documentation for the function.\"\"\"\n",
    "    body_of_function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A great way to use \"docstrings\" is to have an example of using the function, with its expected output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def my_function(x):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Sample usage:\n",
    "    >>> my_function(“example input”)\n",
    "    \"example output\"\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When in an interactive Python section, you can display docstrings with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "help(some_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in your code code you can retrieve it and use it in your program just as you would with any other string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "some_function.__doc__\n",
    "print(some_function.__doc__)\n",
    "function_explanation = other_function.__doc__\n",

    "#### 05.01.12 Reading: Python in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done! Everything that you’ve been learning and all your hard work have brought you to this point. You’ve learned how to write a Python script from the ground up to solve a complex problem. You’ve also practiced how to:\n",
    "- Identify a problem statement.\n",
    "- Research the tools needed to help solve the problem.\n",
    "- Plan an approach or best strategy to figure out what needs to be done, how it’s done, and how to structure the code.\n",
    "- Write a script to solve the problem.\n",
    "- Run and check that the code works the way it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now take a look at an example of how you can apply this process in the real world. This reading will provide you with a real-life example and walk you through the application of each step in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Problem and Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine this scenario: Every month, you are handed a spreadsheet with hundreds of new hires. You are asked to create user accounts for all of them on a Linux server. The formatting on the spreadsheet looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "username,password,real_name\n",
    "amanda,,Amanda Alonso\n",
    "ian,,Ian Ortega\n",
    "eugene,,Eugene Konya\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the password field is empty for all the records. This means you need to generate random passwords for each user and then create their accounts. You also want to write the passwords that you generate back to a new CSV file so that you can tell the new employees their passwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task isn’t difficult, but it is time-intensive if you create passwords and accounts for the hundreds of new hires one by one. Your solution is to automate this task in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Script\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate the task of creating passwords and accounts for all of these new hires, the script should do the following:\n",
    "- Read a list of new hires from `users_in.csv`.\n",
    "- Generate random 16-character passwords for each user.\n",
    "- Create each user account.\n",
    "- Write the spreadsheet back to `users_out.csv` with the new passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Your Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "To help organize all the data, create accounts for the new hires, and create passwords for each new user, you first need to import a few standard Python libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This library helps read and write the CSV files. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import secrets\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps generate random passwords for each user account. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import subprocess\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This calls the `useradd` command, which creates and adds each user account.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pathlib import Path   # to locate the data files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This library helps to locate the data files for each user account.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the libraries that help you execute your script, you need to get the current working directory and find the subdirectory where the CSV files are stored. Use `cwd` for “current working directory” and identify the path of the Python directory as a string: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cwd = Path.cwd() / \"drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you use a `with` statement and an `as` keyword. The `with` statement helps with resource management, and the `as` keyword creates an alias for the resource you want to call. Consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(cwd / \"data/users_in.csv\", \"r\") as file_input, open(cwd / \"data/users_out.csv\", \"w\") as file_output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV library takes care of reading and parsing the input from the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can use a `DictReader` object so that each row in the file is read into a `dict()` with the field names and values, like this: `{\"username\": \"amanda\", \"password\": \"\", \"real_name\": \"Amanda Alonso\"}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is an example of how you use the `DictReader`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\treader = csv.DictReader(file_input)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The input for the script is now complete! Now you need to set up the output. You create a `DictWriter` and use the same field names from the input, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "writer = csv.DictWriter(file_output,fieldnames=reader.fieldnames)\n",
    "\twriter.writeheader()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you create a for loop to run through each record from the input file. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tfor user in reader:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the for loop, you use the secrets library that you imported at the beginning of the script to generate a random password of eight hex bytes, which equals 16 characters in total. Then, run the /sbin/useradd command to create each user. The check=True parameter causes the script to exit with a CalledProcessError if the command fails for any reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tuser[\"password\"] = secrets.token_hex(8)\n",
    "\tuseradd_cmd = [\"/sbin/useradd\",\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\"-c\", user[\"real_name\"],\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\"-m\",\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\"-G\", \"users\",\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\"-p\", user[\"password\"],\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\tuser[\"username\"]]\n",
    "\tsubprocess.run(useradd_cmd, check=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you write the records back to the output file, including the passwords. When you run the code, the new user accounts and their passwords are generated into a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\twriter.writerow(user)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the script runs, the output CSV file should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![course01_05.01.12_users_out_csv.png](../images/course01_05.01.12_users_out_csv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have it! You’ve just saved yourself countless hours of creating hundreds of new employee accounts and passwords by creating a short, simple script to do the work for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many real-world applications for using Python: creating programs, solving complex problems, simplifying and/or automating time-intensive tasks, and many more. But the process always remains the same—identifying a problem, coming up with a solution, determining the tools that help you achieve your solution, as well as the most significant part—writing the actual script! As you saw in this example, any time you have a repetitive task, think of using Python to automate that task. The programming skills you’ve learned can make the work you do in your IT job a lot faster and more efficient!\n",

    "#### 05.02.04 Reading: Finding Your Path and Perfect Role\n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin your career, you’ll have to navigate your way to find the perfect role for you. While there is no one way to find your ideal role, there are some things to consider to help you better understand what direction you want to take. This reading will focus on a few of the options to consider as you start to search for a job. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Generalist VS. Specialist\n",
    "\n",
    "One category to consider when attempting to find your right path is whether you want to work as a generalist or a specialist. A generalist is knowledgeable about many topics and has various interests, while a specialist is an expert in a specific field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generalists have broad, multifaceted roles that allow entry-level employees to gain invaluable experience in many different areas related to the field. Alternatively, specialists are focused on a singular aspect of IT. The table below provides an overview of common generalist and specialist roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common generalist roles: \n",
    "- IT Support Specialist II\n",
    "- IT Consultant\n",
    "- IT Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Common specialist roles: \n",
    "- Automation Engineer\n",
    "- Python Developer\n",
    "- Software Engineer\n",
    "- Cloud Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the word “specialist” is often used in job titles, even for roles that include generalist-like tasks. When reviewing a job listing, be sure to read the duties and responsibilities assigned to that role so that you have a clear understanding of what you will be doing if hired. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choose Your Work Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing what type of environment works best for you is just as important as the type of role you select. Different types of environments have their own cultures and practices. As an entry-level employee, you’ll come across two types of workplaces: agency or in-house. You can also choose to work for yourself in a freelance role or even start your own business.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Agency VS. In-house Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IT field, there are special agencies that offer IT services and technical personnel to other businesses on a contracted basis. These agencies can support multiple small to medium companies and often operate independently from the businesses they serve. As an entry-level employee in an IT service agency, you can expect to provide services to several clients. Short-term assignments are also common in agency contracts. Agencies may or may not offer employee benefits to their contracted technical personnel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, large companies and enterprises are likely to have an “in-house” team of internal employees to handle their IT needs. Although it is costly to employ an internal IT department, larger businesses prefer to have full transparency with their IT team and full control over the privacy of their users and confidential information. As an entry-level employee in an in-house IT department, you can expect to work closely with an IT team that has a variety of technical skills. It is common to build strong relationships with your team members, as you support one another on long-term projects. Internal IT department employees often hold full-time permanent positions and receive employee benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Large VS. Small Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a general idea of what you’re looking for in a work environment will help you narrow down your job search and land opportunities that are a better fit for you. You may prefer to work onsite for a large company for the diverse social atmosphere and professional networking opportunities. Some large companies and enterprises offer onsite cafeterias, gyms, and childcare, in addition to comprehensive employee benefit packages and career path opportunities. Or, you may prefer to work for a smaller company where you can form closer working relationships with smaller teams. You may want to work for a company that offers flexible work schedules and options that allow you to work from home, in the office, or a hybrid between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "As you navigate your job search, think about what you want in a career. Establish the types of roles you want to start with and the type of company you want to work for. Over time, your experience will help you make better-informed decisions related to your career direction. \n",

    "#### 05.02.06 Reading: Diversity and Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest terms, diversity means something that is different from the norm. Diversity in the workplace represents how organizations and their employees connect, engage, and respect people across all types of differences. More companies are beginning to emphasize their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) metrics as a way to stand out from their competitors. Companies with good DEI metrics tend to have higher employee retention rates, more satisfied employees, and increased innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity starts at the very top with a company’s executive leadership. Examine the leadership at the company you want to work for. The people working at the executive level is typically a good indicator of how diverse and well-represented their employees are as well. If a company’s executive leadership does not embrace diversity, the employees will experience greater difficulties in creating and maintaining that culture. Some questions to ask yourself as you are conducting research on companies:\n",
    "- Does the company share their progress openly? \n",
    "- Do they provide education and training opportunities to learn more about DEI and how people in the workplace are impacted? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to assess whether or not a company practices diversity and inclusion. Here are a few resources to explore and gain better insights on the company:\n",
    "- The company’s website. Assess their core values, history, mission statement, and keywords. See if their website includes any photographs of their employees. \n",
    "- Their social media page(s). What kind of pictures and content do they post publicly? Check for photos of their employees, community outings, whether or not they recognize or celebrate various events or historical moments such as pride month, black history month, or world mental health day as a couple examples.\n",
    "- Interview former employees. Conduct informational interviews to learn more about a company in general and ensure that workplace culture will be a good fit for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unconscious/Implicit Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Unconscious or implicit bias refers to the attitudes, stereotypes, judgements, or prejudices that we have unconsciously in our brain. This bias makes our reactions, thinking, and predisposition to information, actions, or environments alter in a particular way, whether it be positive or negative, without self awareness of its occurrence. It occurs beyond our control and could impact our decisions, actions, and understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unconscious bias is present, to some degree, in every single person and is developed from an early age through the course of one's life. Unconscious bias is associated with many characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and educational background. Some of the common types of unconscious bias are:\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several components and aspects of your potential career to consider while you are job searching. Before embarking on your journey, it is important to outline your career path. Doing so will help you find opportunities that align with your values, interests, and aspirations. As a Python automation developer, you have a myriad of options available to you. Many industries are hiring IT professionals to assist with Python development, debugging code, troubleshooting issues, recommending solutions, and automating processes on cloud platforms and in Linux environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Identifying Career Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want to accomplish as a Python automation professional? There are multiple specialist fields in the IT industry that will give you the opportunity to further develop and hone your skills in automating with Python. However, you can just as easily take the generalist route and cross-apply your knowledge of Python, cloud computing, and Linux to various roles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you aspire to eventually work in management in any capacity? If so, it’s important during your job hunt to ask about opportunities for advancement or transition throughout the company. Some companies are limited in opportunities due to long-term employee retention or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are your unique strengths and skills that you bring with you to a company? Identifying your strengths, both soft and hard skills, will help you stand out from other applicants. There are a plethora of transferable skills that you can use to leverage your application. If you’re not sure where to start on identifying your unique strengths and identifying your transferable skills, there are lots of online resources and platforms to help you get an idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "Skill stacking is becoming more appealing to hiring managers and companies within the field of technology. Skill stacking is when employees combine skills from different fields or industries to produce novel ideas, approaches, and systems. Soft skills are the most important skills to have if you’re considering any position in management or if you want to work in a team-based work environment. Having the skills to hold conversations, navigate conflict, and collaborate with others will highly benefit your career.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating a Timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question that is asked in interviews is, “where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?” Creating a timeline for you and your career is helpful in gaining insight into what career opportunities will work best for you moving forward. One helpful way to gain clarity into this is to break down your bigger career goals into smaller goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach your job search and career in IT with an open mind. Be flexible with deadlines, milestones, and your own personal timeline. Be receptive to potential job opportunities that you might not traditionally apply to or pursue. Adaptability and flexibility are two of the most coveted soft skills employers look for in their employees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, hold yourself accountable for your own progress. Technology is always changing and staying informed of all the changes that pertain to your job or specialty will give you an advantage over other employees. Look at taking other certifications, take online courses, read books on the subject, attend conferences, continuously network with other professionals in your field, and/or complete passion projects in your free time. Taking extra measures to inform yourself about your field and attending events with other professionals will greatly increase your chances of success and career satisfaction.\n",

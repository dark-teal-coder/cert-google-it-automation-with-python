# Solutions to Problems in Crash Course on Python

There are a few types of questions in the quizzes in the course. See the list of the question types below.

1. Multiple choice
2. Code
3. Value input/output

For type 1, start the solution with `- [x]`; for type 2, use triple backticks to create a Python code block; for type 3, use single backticks.

The graded assessments usually have 10 questions in them but there is a pool of over 10 questions for every graded assessment. Therefore, we get different questions every time we attempt the assessments. The following solutions may not all be the same as what you see when you do the assessments.

    while number % 2 == 0 and number != 0:
        number = number / 2
    # If after dividing by 2 "number" equals 1, then "number" is a power of 2.
    if number == 1:
        return True
    return False
  
# Calls to the function
print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True

    while multiplier <= 5:
        result = number * multiplier 
        if  result > 25:
            # Enter the action to take if the result > 25
            break
        print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))

    if number < base:
        # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
        return base**0 == number
    # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.

    start = n
    n -= 1
    while n > 0: # The while loop should execute as long as n is greater than 0

    emails = []
    for domain, users in domains.items():
      for user in users:

```

***Solution 02***

```python
def groups_per_user(group_dictionary):
    user_groups = {}
    # Go through group_dictionary
    for group, users in group_dictionary.items():
        # Now go through the users in the group

            # Now add the group to the the list of groups for this user,
            # creating the entry in the dictionary if necessary
            if user in user_groups:
                user_groups[user].append(group)
            else:
                user_groups[user] = [group]

    return(user_groups)

- [x] `{'shirt': ['red', 'blue', 'white'], 'jeans': ['white'], 'scarf': ['yellow'], 'socks': ['black', 'brown']}`

***Solution 04***

- [x] Itâ€™s quicker and easier to find a specific element in a dictionary

***Solution 05***

```python
def add_prices(basket):
    # Initialize the variable that will be used for the calculation
    total = 0
    # Iterate through the dictionary items
    for price in basket.values():
        # Add each price to the total calculation
        # Hint: how do you access the values of
        # dictionary items?
        total += price
    # Limit the return value to 2 decimal places
    return round(total, 2)

groceries = {"bananas": 1.56, "apples": 2.50, "oranges": 0.99, "bread": 4.59,
    "coffee": 6.99, "milk": 3.39, "eggs": 2.98, "cheese": 5.44}

print(add_prices(groceries)) # Should print 28.44

***Solution 01***

```python
def format_address(address_string):
    house_number = ""
    street_name = ""
    ## Separate the house number from the street name
    address_parts = address_string.split()
    
    for address_part in address_parts:
        ## Complete the if-statement with a string method  
        if address_part.isnumeric():
          house_number = address_part
        else:
          street_name += address_part + " "
    ## Remove the extra space at the end of the last "street_name"
    street_name = street_name.strip()
 
    ## Use a string method to return the required formatted string.
    return f"House number {house_number} on a street named {street_name}"

print(format_address("123 Main Street"))
## Output: "House number 123 on a street named Main Street"
print(format_address("1001 1st Ave"))
## Output: "House number 1001 on a street named 1st Ave"
print(format_address("55 North Center Drive"))
## Output: "House number 55 on a street named North Center Drive"
```

***Solution 02***

```python
def highlight_word(sentence, word):
    # Complete the return statement using a string method.
    return sentence.replace(word, word.upper())

print(highlight_word("Have a nice day", "nice"))
# Should print: "Have a NICE day"
print(highlight_word("Shhh, don't be so loud!", "loud"))
# Should print: "Shhh, don't be so LOUD!"
print(highlight_word("Automating with Python is fun", "fun"))
# Should print: "Automating with Python is FUN"
```

***Solution 03***

```python
def sort_distance(distances):
    # Sort the list
    # Reverse the order of the list
    distances.sort(reverse=True) 
    return distances

print(sort_distance([2,4,0,15,8,9]))
# Should print [15, 9, 8, 4, 2, 0]
```

***Solution 04***

```python
def even_numbers(first, last):
  return [num for num in range(first, last) if num%2==0]

print(even_numbers(4, 14)) ## Output: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
print(even_numbers(0, 9)) ## Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
print(even_numbers(2, 7)) ## Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

***Solution 05***

```python
def countries(countries_dict):
    result = ""
    ## Complete the for loop to iterate through the dictionary key and value items
    for countries in countries_dict.values():
        ## Use a string method to format the required string
        result += str(countries) + "\n"
    return result.strip()

print(countries({"Africa": ["Kenya", "Egypt", "Nigeria"], 
    "Asia":["China", "India", "Thailand"],

## ['Ecuador', 'Bolivia', 'Brazil']
```

***Solution 06***

```python
def setup_guests(guest_list):
    # loop over the guest list and add each guest to the dictionary with
    # an initial value of 0
    result = {} # Initialize a new dictionary 
    for guest in guest_list: # Iterate over the elements in the list 
        result[guest] = 0 # Add each list element to the dictionary as a key with 
            # the starting value of 0
    return result

guests = ["Adam","Camila","David","Jamal","Charley","Titus","Raj","Noemi","Sakira","Chidi"]
print(setup_guests(guests))
# Should print {'Adam': 0, 'Camila': 0, 'David': 0, 'Jamal': 0, 'Charley': 0, 'Titus': 0, 'Raj': 0, 'Noemi': 0, 'Sakira': 0, 'Chidi': 0}
```

***Solution 07***

```python
def count_letters(text):
  ## Initialize a new dictionary
  dictionary = {}
  ## Complete the for loop to iterate through each "text" character and 
  ## use a string method to ensure all letters are lowercase.
  for ch in text.lower():   
    ## Complete the if-statement using a string method to check if the
    ## character is a letter.
    if ch.isalpha():
      ## Complete the if-statement using a logical operator to check if 
      ## the letter is not already in the dictionary.
      if ch not in dictionary: 
          ## Use a dictionary operation to add the letter as a key
          ## and set the initial count value to zero.
          dictionary[ch] = 0
      ## Use a dictionary operation to increment the letter count value 
      ## for the existing key.
      dictionary[ch] += 1 ## Increment the letter counter 
  return dictionary


print(count_letters("AaBbCc"))
## Output: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
print(count_letters("Math is fun! 2+2=4"))
## Output: {'m': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 1, 'f': 1, 'u': 1, 'n': 1}
print(count_letters("This is a sentence."))
## Output: {'t': 2, 'h': 1, 'i': 2, 's': 3, 'a': 1, 'e': 3, 'n': 2, 'c': 1}

    "\n",
    "#### 01.02.04 Reading: Uses for Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uses for Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts can be used for automating specific tasks. Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. Humans are fallible. They can become tired, make mistakes, fail to follow instructions, be inconsistent in their job performance, and more. In contrast, automated processes complete instructions exactly as coded, in a consistent manner. They can run 24 hours a day, everyday, without tiring. For many tasks that are appropriate for automation, it can be more cost effective to use automation than human labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate uses for automation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The automatic timing and regulation of traffic lights\n",
    "- A repetitive task that is at high risk for human error\n",
    "- Sending commands to a computer\n",
    "- Detecting and removing duplicates of data\n",
    "- Sending automated emails that are personalized by pulling individual names from a database and plugging them into the email \n",
    "- Updating a large number of file permissions\n",
    "- Reporting on system data, like disk or memory usage\n",
    "- Installing software\n",
    "- Generating reports\n",
    "- Deploying a file or a computer program to all computers on a company network\n",
    "- Using a configuration management system to deploy software patches, after a human has designed the system\n",
    "- Populating an e-commerce site with products\n",
    "- Setting the home directory and access permissions for users\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Automation Is Not Always an Appropriate or Complete Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation cannot perform all human work. Tasks that call for human creativity, social connection, psychology, flexibility, ingenuity, evaluation, and/or complex analytic work are not good candidates for full automation. Sometimes automation can be used to perform one or more subtasks of a larger set of tasks – but – human intervention is required to complete the tasks. The following are some examples of tasks that cannot or should not be fully automated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Items that require human evaluation and analytic skills:\n",
    "  - Designing a configuration management system\n",
    "  - Investigating and troubleshooting all end user problems\n",
    "  - Writing a computer program\n",
    "  - Building a new startup business\n",
    "- Items that require human creativity and/or an eye for aesthetic qualities:\n",
    "  - Designing an attractive webpage (AI can do this, but simple automation cannot) \n",
    "  - Wedding photography\n",
    "  - Haircuts and styling\n",
    "- Items that cannot be automated due to basic physics:\n",
    "  - Troubleshooting or repairing machines that cannot power on or boot up \n",
    "- Items that need human interaction, psychology, and/or evaluation skills:\n",
    "  - Interviewing and hiring new employees\n",
    "  - Customer service (chat bots cannot address every customer service need)\n",
    "- Items that should not be fully automated due to costs and safety:\n",
    "  - Grocery store checkout process, including bagging groceries\n",
    "  - Tasks that are less expensive to perform manually\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that basic automation is not the same as artificial intelligence. Automation is used to explicitly instruct a machine on how to perform a task. Artificial intelligence (AI) involves training a computing machine to perform more complex tasks through a process called machine learning. This process prepares the AI software to perform new tasks without a human needing to program explicit instructions for each task. Although AI is often used for automating human tasks, AI automation is much more complex than basic automation.\n",

    "- Working in IT, a lot of what we do boils down to using a computer to perform a certain task. In your job you might create user accounts, configure the network, install software, backup existing data, or execute a whole range of other computer based tasks from day to day.\n",
    "- Tasks performed by a computer that need to be done multiple times with little variation are really well suited for automation, because when you automate a task you avoid the possibility of human errors, and reduce the time it takes to do it.\n",
    "- Automating tasks allows you to focus on projects that are a better use of your time, letting computers do the boring stuff for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 01.02.06 Reading: Study Guide: Introduction to Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first practice quiz is coming up soon. This handy study guide should help you prepare for that quiz. The practice quizzes do not count towards your grade in this course. Practice quizzes are opportunities for you to check your understanding of the materials before you take the graded assessments at the end of each module.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Programming code***: Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Programming languages***: Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Syntax***: Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Semantics*** Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Computer program***: A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++,  R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Script***: Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Automation***: Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Output***: Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Input***: Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Functions***: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Variables***: Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code. \n",

    "When writing code, using correct syntax is critical. Even a small typo, like a missing parenthesis bracket or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes. A single wrong character could take hours to identify in long code so it is important to be mindful of syntax when writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common syntax errors: \n",
    "- Misspellings\n",
    "- Incorrect indentations\n",
    "- Missing or incorrect key characters:\n",
    "  - Bracket types - `(` curved `)`, `[` square `]`, `{` curly `}`\n",
    "  - Quote types - `\"`straight-double`\"` or `'`straight-single`'`, `“`curly-double`”` or `‘`curly-single`’`\n",
    "  - Block introduction characters, like colons - `:`\n",
    "- Data type mismatches\n",
    "- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words\n",
    "- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language \n",
    "\n",
    "If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Syntax is like the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of code. Semantics are the meaning and logic of coded statements. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common semantic errors:\n",
    "- Creating functional code, but getting unintentional output\n",
    "- Poor logic structures in the design of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with the code blocks in exercises for this course, be mindful of syntax and semantic (logic) errors, along with the overall result of your code. Just because you fixed an error doesn't mean that the code will have the desired effect when it runs! Once you’ve fixed an error in your code, don't forget to click Run to check your work.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this segment, you learned that Python is a general purpose programming language that is commonly used for scripting and automation, as well as to develop a wide variety of applications. Python is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and is updated every few years. Python can also run on a variety of machines, such as servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is widely used in the IT field, including IT support, system administration, web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Python can be used to calculate statistics, run your e-commerce site, process images, interact with web services, and do a whole host of other tasks. Python instructions resemble the English language, which is what makes it easier to learn and understand when compared to other programming languages.\n",

    "| `Hello, how are you?`             | `Hello, how are you?`         |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language***: Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Client-side scripting language***: Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Machine language***: Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Cross-platform language***: Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Object-oriented programming language***: In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Python interpreter***: An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.\n",

    "##### Reminder: Correct Syntax is Critical\n",
    "\n",
    "Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now. \n",
    "\n",
    "No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately, you have 3 optional retake opportunities on the graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimited retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before starting the graded quiz, review this list of common syntax errors coders make when writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common syntax errors:\n",
    "- Misspellings\n",
    "- Incorrect indentations\n",
    "- Missing or incorrect key characters:\n",
    "- Parenthetical types - `(` curved `)`, `[` square `]`, `{` curly `}`\n",
    "- Quote types - `\"`straight-double`\"` or `'`straight-single`'`, `“`curly-double`”` or `‘`curly-single`’`\n",
    "- Block introduction characters, like colons - `:`\n",
    "- Data type mismatches\n",
    "- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words\n",
    "- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language \n",

    "\n",
    "Basic building blocks of Python syntax: e.g., vriables, expressions, functions, conditional blocks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 02.01.02 Reading: Explore Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language used in a wide range of fields, including software development, machine learning, and data analysis. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data professionals, so getting familiar with its fundamental syntax and semantics will be useful for your future career. In this reading, you will learn about Python’s syntax and semantics, as well as where to find resources to further your learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Language of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "People use language to communicate and give instructions to each other. Computers do the same thing, except computers use languages like Python, C++, and Java. So, in order to communicate instructions to the computer, programmers need to arrange ideas and concepts into a language it will understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax includes words that represent objects and commands, as well as punctuation that gives the words structure, hierarchy, and context. Together, the words and punctuation communicate ideas and processes; this is known as semantics. Semantics is the meaning conveyed by the syntax. The best way to learn syntax and semantics is through exposure. Practice coding and become familiar and comfortable with reading other people’s code. In addition, there are some general conventions that practitioners use to help maintain stylistic uniformity within the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coding languages are similar to spoken languages in that they have a way to classify words according to their function. For example, English sentences are composed of nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc. Here are some of the basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Variables***: Represent data stored as strings, tuples, dictionaries, lists, and objects (note: future readings explain these categories)\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Keywords***: Special words that are reserved for specific purposes and that can only be used for those purposes\n",
    "  - e.g., `in`, `not`, `or`, `for`, `while`, `return`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Operators***: Symbols that perform operations on objects and values\n",
    "  - i.e., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`, `//`, `>`, `<`, and `==`\n",
    "\n",
    "- >***Expressions***: A combination of numbers, symbols, and variables to compute and return a result upon evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- >***Functions***: A group of related statements to perform a task and return a value\n",
    "  - e.g.,\n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\tdef to_celsius(x):\n",
    "\t   '''Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius'''\n",
    "\t   return (x-32) * 5/9\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\tto_celsius(75)\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\n",
    "- >***Conditional statements***: Sections of code that direct program execution based on specified conditions\n",
    "  - e.g., \n",
    "\t```python\n",
    "\tnumber = -4\n",
    "\n",
    "\tif number > 0:\n",
    "\t   print('Number is positive.')\n",
    "\telif number == 0:\n",
    "\t   print('Number is zero.')\n",
    "\telse:\n",
    "\t   print('Number is negative.')\n",
    "\t```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Naming Rules and Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "When assigning names to objects, programmers adhere to a set of rules and conventions which help to standardize code and make it more accessible to everyone. Here are some naming rules and conventions that you should know:\n",
    "- Names cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "- Names may be a mixture of upper and lower case characters.\n",
    "- Names can’t start with a number but may contain numbers after the first character.\n",
    "- Variable names and function names should be written in snake_case, which means that all letters are lowercase and words are separated using an underscore. \n",
    "- Descriptive names are better than cryptic abbreviations because they help other programmers (and you) read and interpret your code. For example, student_name is better than sn. It may feel excessive when you write it, but when you return to your code you’ll find it much easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is a more exhaustive resource for style-related matters. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals. These are a running catalog of ways to improve or standardize Python as a language. Because Python is open source, PEP offers a framework to guide developers and build consensus around ideas. It’s a useful and trusted resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax and semantics are what give form and meaning to a language, including Python.  A large part of learning a new language is familiarizing yourself with its syntax and semantics. Much of this comes through exposure and practice, but there are a few guiding principles and resources that can help you along the way. If you learn the rules about naming objects and build a bank of resources that you can reference for guidance, you’ll surely make progress as a Python learner. As you get more familiar with Python, you’ll be able to communicate more efficiently with computers and do more with your data analysis tools!\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 02.01.05 Reading: Annotating Variables by Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotation allows you to clearly communicate the argument types and return type of functions in your code. It’s like giving yourself and other developers hints about what kind of data the variable is supposed to hold. This has several benefits: It reduces the chance of common mistakes, helps in documenting your code for others to reuse, and allows integrated development software (IDEs) and other tools to give you better feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn more about annotating variables by type and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Annotate a Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of annotating a variable as if you were to put a label on a container—and anything in that container should hold what the label is describing. Let’s take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name: str = “Betty”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable name is declared using a colon (`:`) which is annotated with the type `str`, indicating that the name variable should hold a string value. And look, it does! Betty—or any name for that matter—is a string, and we know it’s a string because it is in quotes. Let’s look at another example where a variable holds an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age: int = 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `age` is the variable, and `int` is the type annotation that provides you and other developers a hint that the age variable should store an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: If a function expects a list of integers, you should annotate it as `List[int]`, not just `List`. Being specific with your types can catch more potential bugs and misunderstandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages, such as C# or Java, require you to declare variable types, but not Python. One of the great things about Python is that the type of variable can change over time as new values are assigned to it. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3                  #a is an integer\n",
    "a = “Hello world”      #a is now a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing allows programmers to write code more quickly and offers flexibility because you don’t have to explicitly declare the type of variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Python decides which of the built-in types the variable is and, therefore, how it should behave. For more information, refer to this article on [Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of typing comes from the saying, “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.” Python will infer the variable type at runtime and decide which behaviors are available to the given object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = “Hello world”      #looks like a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Annotating Variables with Type Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to annotate variables is to use type comments where the interpreter will ignore the comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "captain = “Picard”      # type: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This way of annotating variables might be useful for cases when you need to know what types belong to which variables but do not want the overhead of using a line interpreter (linter) or IDE on this specific variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Annotating Variables Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use the same example above to annotate a variable directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "captain: str = “Picard”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You might hear annotating variables directly called the more “modern” way to annotate a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that you can use automated tools such as linters, or mypy, to check types to make code more resilient. Most modern IDEs, such as VS Code and JetBrains PyCharm, scan code for type annotations and can use it to help you write better code more quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Type Annotations Affect Runtime Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time a library is called, or an IDE works to scan your code, more computational overhead is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: Be strategic when annotating variables by type. This can add unnecessary overhead when overused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotation is less common with Python users in data science, as it can be burdensome to manually map data every time a new set of data comes in. On the other hand, when doing object-oriented programming or writing functions, using type annotations becomes extremely important because it helps clarify code since you are dealing with more than just the built-in types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotating variables by type provides programmers with benefits to make the code easier to read and understand. Python provides different options on how to annotate variables, so choose how you want to annotate them. Just be cautious of over-annotating, creating unnecessary overhead to your code.\n",

    "As we saw earlier in the video, some data types can be mixed and matched due to implicit conversion. Implicit conversion is where the interpreter helps us out and automatically converts one data type into another, without having to explicitly tell it to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. We used this in our video example when we wanted to print a number alongside some text. Before we could do that, we needed to call the `str()` function to convert the number into a string. Once the number was explicitly converted to a string, we could join it with the rest of our textual string and print the result.\n",

    "#### 02.02.03 Reading: Built-in Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Built-in Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last video, we explored built-in functions in Python, including `print()`, `type()`, and `str()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Built-in functions***: Functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll explore these further and also learn about the `sorted()` function and `max()` and `min()` function. In addition, you'll review how to pass the output of one function into another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `print()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function outputs a specified object to the screen. The `print()` function is one of the most commonly used functions in Python because it allows you to output any detail from your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `print()` function, you pass the object you want to print as an argument to the function. The `print()` function takes in any number of arguments, separated by a comma, and prints all of them. For example, you can run the following code that prints a string, a variable, another string, and an integer together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "month = \"September\"\n",
    "print(\"Investigate failed login attempts during\", month, \"if more than\", 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `type()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `type()` function returns the data type of its argument. The `type()` function helps you keep track of the data types of variables to avoid errors throughout your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you pass the object as an argument, and it returns its data type. It only accepts one argument. For example, you could specify `type(\"security\")` or `type(7)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Passing One Function into Another\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with functions, you often need to pass them through print() if you want to output the data type to the screen. This is the case when using a function like type(). Consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(type(\"This is a string\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It displays `<class 'str'>`, which means that the argument passed to the `type()` function is a string. This happens because the `type()` function is processed first and its output is passed as an argument to the `print()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `str()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str()` function can be used to convert any data type to a string. The `str()` function takes a single argument, which is the value that you want to convert to a string. The `str()` function will then return a string representation of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `str()` function will convert the number 12 to a string. This will run the code and print the string representation of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = 12\n",
    "string_representation = str(number)\n",
    "print(string_representation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `sorted()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sorted()` function sorts the components of a list. The `sorted()` function also works on any iterable, like a string, and returns the sorted elements in a list. By default, it sorts them in ascending order. When given an iterable that contains numbers, it sorts them from smallest to largest; this includes iterables that contain numeric data as well as iterables that contain string data beginning with numbers. An iterable that contains strings that begin with alphabetic characters will be sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sorted()` function takes an iterable, like a list or a string, as an input. So, for example, you can use the following code to sort the list of login sessions from shortest to longest:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
    "print(sorted(time_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This displays the sorted list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `sorted()` function does not change the iterable that it sorts. The following code illustrates this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
    "print(sorted(time_list))\n",
    "print(time_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `print()` function displays the sorted list. However, the second `print()` function, which does not include the `sorted()` function, displays the list as assigned to time_list in the first line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more important detail about the `sorted()` function is that it cannot take lists or strings that have elements of more than one data type. For example, you can’t use the list `[1, 2, \"hello\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `max()` and `min()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max()` function returns the largest numeric input passed into it. The `min()` function returns the smallest numeric input passed into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max()` and `min()` functions accept arguments of either multiple numeric values or of an iterable like a list, and they return the largest or smallest value respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could use these functions to identify the longest or shortest session that a user logged in for. If a specific user logged in seven times during a week, and you stored their access times in minutes in a list, you can use the `max()` and `min()` functions to find and print their longest and shortest sessions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]\n",
    "print(min(time_list))\n",
    "print(max(time_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in functions are powerful tools in Python that allow you to perform tasks with one simple command. The `print()` function prints its arguments to the screen, the `type()` function returns the data type of its argument, the `sorted()` organizes its argument, and the `min()` and `max()` functions return the smallest and largest values of an iterable respectively.\n",

Comparison operators return Boolean results. As you learned previously, Boolean is a data type that can hold only one of two values: `True` or `False`. \n",
    "\n",

    "- `<=` (less than or equal to)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PART 1: Equality `==` and Not Equal To `!=` Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a Boolean result: `True` or `False`. Note that Boolean data types are not string data types (Boolean `True` is not equal to the string \"True\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "- To check if two values are the same, use the equality operator: `==` \n",
    "- To check if two values are not the same, use the not equal to operator: `!=`\n",

    "##### The Equality `==` Operator VS. the Equals `=` Operator \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the equality `==` comparison operator performs a different task than the equals `=` assignment operator. The equals `=` operator assigns the value on the right side of the equals `=` to the object (e.g., a variable) on the left side of the equals `=` operator. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn more about what comparison operators can and cannot do. If you use the `==` (equality) and `!=` (not equal to) operators with strings, you can check if two strings contain the same text or not. You can also alphabetize strings using `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to) comparison operators. As with numeric data types, comparison operators used with strings will return Boolean (`True`, `False`) results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### PART 1: Equality `==` and Not Equal to `!=` Operators with Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare strings. The equality `==` and the not equal to `!=` operators are helpful when you need to search for a specific string in a body of text, a log file, a spreadsheet, a database, and more. You can also check user input strings to compare them to another string. Note that Boolean data types are not string data types (Boolean `True` is not equal to the string `\"True\"`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The == operator can check if 2 strings are equal to each other. If they are equal, the Python interpreter returns a True result.\n",
    "print(\"a string\" == \"a string\") # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the equality == comparison is between \"4 + 5\" and 4 + 5. Since the left data type is a string and the right data type is an integer, the 2 values cannot be equal. So, the comparison returns a False result.\n",
    "print(\"4 + 5\" == 4 + 5) # False\n",
    "\n",
    "# The != operator can check if the 2 strings are NOT equal to each other. If they are indeed not equal, then Python returns a True result.\n",
    "print(\"rabbit\" != \"frog\") # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the variable event_city has been assigned the string value \"Shanghai\". This variable is compared to a static string, \"Shanghai\", using the != operator. As, the strings \"Shanghai\" and \"Shanghai\" are the same, the comparison of \"Shanghai\" != \"Shanghai\" is false. Accordingly, Python will return a False result.\n",
    "event_city = \"Shanghai\"\n",

    "# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare 2 items of different data types using the equality == operator. The 2 items are not equal, so the comparison returns False.\n",
    "print(\"three\" == 3) #False\n",

    "\n",
    "##### PART 2: The Greater Than `>` and Less Than `<` Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison operators greater than `>` and less than `<` can be used to alphabetize words in Python. The letters of the alphabet have numeric codes in Unicode (also known as ASCII values). The uppercase letters A to Z are represented by the Unicode values 65 to 90. The lowercase letters a to z are represented by the Unicode values 97 to 122. \n",

    "- To check if the first letter(s) of a string have a smaller Unicode value (meaning the letter is closer to 65 or uppercase A) than the first letter of another string, use the less than operator: `<`\n",
    "\n",
    "Like numeric comparisons with the greater than `>` and less than `<` operators, comparisons between strings also return Boolean `True` or `False` results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher Unicode value than the right string. If true, the Python interpreter returns a True result. Since W has a Unicode value of 87, and you can easily calculate that F has a Unicode value of 70, this comparison is the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True result.\n",
    "print(\"Wednesday\" > \"Friday\") # True\n",
    "  \n",
    "# The less than < operator checks if the left string has a lower Unicode value than the right string. If you reference the Unicode chart above, you can see that all lowercase letters have higher Unicode values than uppercase letters. We can see that B has a Unicode value of 66 and b has a Unicode value of 98. This comparison is the same as 66 < 98, which is true. So, Python will return a True result.\n",
    "print(\"Brown\" < \"brown\") # True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the strings have the same first few letters, the comparison will cycle through each letter of each string, from left to right until it finds 2 letters that have different Unicode values. In this example, both strings share the initial substring \"sun\", but then have different letters with different Unicode values in the fourth place in each string. So, the fourth letters 'b' and 't' of the 2 strings are used for the comparison. Since 'b' does not have a higher Unicode value than 't', the comparison returns a False result.\n",

    "#### 02.03.05 Reading: Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are used to construct more complex expressions. You can make complex comparisons by joining comparison statements together using the logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`. Complex comparisons return a Boolean (`True` or `False`) result. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `and`\n",
    "  - Both sides of the statement being evaluated must be True for the whole statement to be True. \n",
    "  - Example: `(5 > 1 and 5 < 10)` = `True`\n",
    "- `or`\n",
    "  - If either side of the comparison is True, then the whole statement is True. \n",
    "  - Example: `(color = \"blue\" or color = \"green\")` = `True`\n",
    "- `not`\n",
    "  - Inverts the Boolean result of the statement immediately following it. So, if a statement evaluates to True, and we put the not operator in front of it, it would become False. \n",
    "  - Example: `(not \"A\" == \"A\")` = `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PART 1: The `and` Logical Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the logical operator `and` to connect more than one comparison. This type of complex comparison is used to check if two comparison statements are both True or not. You might use the `and` operator when you need to execute a block of code, but only if two different conditions are true. For example, you might want to write a script  that automates sending you an emergency alert if a server stops responding and there is an unusual increase in employees opening trouble tickets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following model demonstrates the use of the `and` logical operator to join comparisons between two mathematical expressions. The description below the example explains the order in which Python will process the line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print((6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the following activities were completed by Python in the following order:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python solves the numerical expressions using the order of operations. `(6*3 >= 18) and (9+9 <= 36/2)` becomes `(18 >= 18)` and `(18 <= 18)`\n",
    "2. Python compares the results of the numerical expressions using the comparison operators (in this case `>=` and `<=`). `(18 >= 18) and (18 <= 18)` becomes `True` and `True`\n",
    "3. Python checks if both sides of the logical operator `and` are true. `True` and `True` become `True`\n",
    "4. Python returns a Boolean value: `True` or `False`. The complex comparison returns a `True` result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next example, `\"Nairobi\" < \"Milan\" and \"Nairobi\" > \"Hanoi\"`, the `and` logical operator is connecting 2 string comparison statements. You learned previously that using the greater than and less than operators on strings will test the alphabetical order (technically Unicode values) of the strings. So, this complex comparison is checking if `\"Nairobi\"` is alphabetized before `\"Milan\"` (`False`) AND after `\"Hanoi\"` (`True`). \n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison returns a False result because both sides of the logical operator are not True. A comparison statement like this might be used to iterate through a list of names to check if they are alphabetized in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Nairobi\" < \"Milan\" and \"Nairobi\" > \"Hanoi\")\n",

    "today = \"Monday\"\n",
    "print(not today == \"Tuesday\") \n",
    "# The \"today\" variable states today is Monday. This makes the comparison \"today == Tuesday\" False. The logical operator \"not\" inverts the False result to become True.

    "A `while` loop will continuously execute code depending on the value of a condition. It begins with the keyword `while`, followed by a comparison to be evaluated, then a colon. On the next line is the code block to be executed, indented to the right. Similar to an `if` statement, the code in the body will only be executed if the comparison is evaluated to be true. What sets a `while` loop apart, however, is that this code block will keep executing as long as the evaluation statement is true. Once the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the `while` loops segment, you learned about the logical structure and syntax of `while` loops. You also learned about the importance of initializing variables and how to resolve infinite `while` loops with the `break` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop executes the body of the loop while a specified condition remains `True`. They are commonly used when there’s an unknown number of operations to be performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while specified condition is True:\n",
    "    body of loop \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "multiplier = 1\n",
    "result = multiplier * 5\n",
    "while result <= 50:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "    multiplier += 1\n",
    "    result = multiplier * 5\n",
    "print(\"Done\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This while loop prints the multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. The \"multiplier\" variable is initialized with the starting value of 1. The \"result\" variable is initialized with the value of the \"multiplier\" variable times 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop specifies that the loop must iterate while it is True that the \"result\" is less than or equal to 50. Within the while loop, the code tells the Python interpreter to print the value of the \"result\" variable. Then, the \"multiplier\" is incremented by 1 and the \"result\" is assigned the new value of the \"multiplier\" times 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The end of the while loop is indicated by the indentation of the next line of code moving one tab to the left. At this point, the Python interpreter automatically loops back to the beginning of the while loop to check the condition again with the new value of the \"result\" variable. When the while loop condition becomes False (meaning \"result\" is no longer less than or equal to 50), the interpreter exits the loop and reads the next line of code outside of the loop. In this case, that next line tells the interpreter to print the string \"Done\". \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common Errors in Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error message on a loop or it appears to hang, your debugging checklist should include the following checks:\n",
    "- Failure to initialize variables - make sure all the variables used in the loop’s condition are initialized before the loop.\n",
    "- Unintended infinite loops - make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables. You can often prevent an infinite loop by using the break keyword or by adding end criteria to the condition part of the `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***while***: A `while` loop tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is true. In other words, `while` loops keep executing the same group of instructions until the condition becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***Infinite loop***: Missing a method for exiting the loop causes the loop to run forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***break***: A `break` statement in Python provides a way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false. Once a `break` statement is encountered, the program's control flow jumps out of the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > ***pass***: A `pass` statement in Python is a placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement without executing any code or command.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Math Concepts on the Practice Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding problems on the upcoming practice quiz will involve a few math concepts. Don’t worry if you are rusty on math. You will have plenty of support with these concepts on the quiz. The following is a quick overview of the math terms you will encounter on the quiz:\n",
    "- > ***Prime numbers***: Integers that have only 2 factors, which are the number itself multiplied by 1.\n",
    "  - E.g., The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29. Each of these prime numbers can be evenly divided only by itself and 1. \n",
    "- > ***Prime factors***: Prime numbers that are factors of an integer.\n",
    "  - E.g., Prime numbers 2 and 5 are the prime factors of the number 10 (2x5=10). The prime factors of an integer will not produce a remainder when used to divide that integer. \n",
    "- > ***Divisor***: A number (denominator) that is used to divide another number (numerator). \n",
    "  - E.g., If the number 10 is divided by 5, the number 5 is the divisor.\n",
    "- > ***Sum of all divisors of a number***: The result of adding all of the divisors of a number together.  \n",
    "- > ***Multiplication table***: An integer multiplied by a series of numbers and their results formatted as a table or a list. \n",

    "#### 03.02.05 Reading: A Closer Look at the `Range()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `in` keyword, when used with the `range()` function, generates a sequence of integer numbers, which can be used with a `for` loop to control the start point, the end point, and the incremental values of the loop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for n in range(x, y, z):\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function uses a set of indices that point to integer values, which start at the number 0. The numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correlate to ordinal index positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. So, when a range call to the 5th index position is made using `range(5)` the index is pointing to the numeric value of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index Number | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th |\n",
    "|:------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "| Value        | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function can take up to three parameters: `range(start, stop, step)`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Start\n",
    "\n",
    "The first item in the `range()` function parameters is the starting position of the range. The default is the first index position, which points to the numeric value 0. This value is included in the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stop\n",
    "\n",
    "The second item in the `range()` function parameters is the ending position of the range. There is no default index position, so this index number must be given to the `range()` parameters. For example, the line `for n in range(4)` will loop 4 times with the `n` variable starting at 0 and looping 4 index positions: 0, 1, 2, 3. As you can see, `range(4)` (meaning index position 4) ends at the numeric value 3. In Python, this structure may be phrased as “the end-of-range value is excluded from the range.” In order to include the value 4 in `range(4)`, the syntax can be written as `range(4+1)` or `range(5)`. Both of these ranges will produce the numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The third item in the `range()` function parameters is the incremental step value. The default increment is +1. The default value can be overridden with any valid increment. However, note that the loop will still end at the end-of-range index position, regardless of the incremental value. For example, if you have a loop with the range: `for n in range(1, 5, 6)`, the range will only produce the numeric value 1. This is because the incremental value of 6 exceeded the ending point of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Practice Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the code block below to test the values of `n` with various `range()` parameters. A few suggestions to test are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`range(stop)`\n",
    "- `range(3)`\n",
    "- `range(3+1)`\n",
    "\n",

    "for n in range(1, 5, 6):  \n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of the `range()` function in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop iterates on the value of the \"n\" variable in a range of 0 to 10 (the value of the end-of-range index 11 is excluded). The incremental value for the loop is 2. The print() function will output the resulting value of \"n\" as the loop counts from 0 to 10 (end-of-range index 11) in incremental steps of 2. This is one method that can be used in Python to print a list of even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for n in range(0,11,2):\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop iterates on the value of the \"number\" variable in a range of 2 to 7+1 (the value of the end-of-range index 7 is excluded, so +1 has been added to the parameter to include the numeric value 7 in the range). The incremental value for the loop is the default of +1. The print() function will output the resulting value of \"number\" multiplied by 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for number in range(2,7+1):\n",
    "    print(number*3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop iterates on the value of the \"x\" variable in a range of 2 to -1 (the end-of-range index -2 is excluded). The third parameter is also a negative number, making it a decremental value of -1. The print() function will output the resulting value of \"x\" as it starts at 2 and counts down to -1 (index -2).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in range(2, -2, -1):\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The roles of the `range(start, stop, step)` function parameters are:\n",
    "- Start - Beginning of range\n",
    "  - value included in range\n",
    "  - default = 0\n",
    "- Stop - End of range\n",
    "  - value excluded from range (to include, use stop+1)\n",

    "#### 03.02.08 Reading: Strings and For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few modules we’ve been talking about using loops and their syntax in Python. As you have seen, a loop is an instruction that repeats multiple times as long as the condition set forth in the loop is met. You use loops to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to send users an invitation, asking them to subscribe every time they open a new project, you would use a loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn the basics about for loops and how you can use them with strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For Loop Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, `for` loops enable you to iterate over a sequence of values, such as numbers, names, or lines in a file. You can even iterate over a list of strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are Strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this course we identified strings as one of the basic data types used by Python and other programming languages. Strings represent a sequence of characters and are often used to display output to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can recognize a string because it’s surrounded by single or double quotes like the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hello world.\"\n",
    "‘Ostriches can’t fly.’\n",
    "\"567.89\" \n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: You can’t mix single and double quotes in the same string or you’ll get a syntax error. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In the examples above, Python does not consider “567.89” a number. It is a string because it is surrounded by quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using For Loops with Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier video, you learned that a for loop iterates over the items in a collection until each item in the collection has been looped over. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: Every for loop can also be written as a while loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see what that looks like. In the example below, we’re using a for loop to print out the characters in the string “Hello.”\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    ">>> greeting = \"Hello\"\n",
    ">>> for c in greeting:\n",
    ">>>   print(\"The next character is: \", c)\n",
    "The next character is: H \n",
    "The next character is: e \n",
    "The next character is: l \n",
    "The next character is: l \n",
    "The next character is: o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `for` loop will stop iterating after the “o” is printed. You can also use `for` loops with Python’s `range()` function to generate a series of numbers, which you can see in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    ">>> for i in range(0, 3):\n",
    ">>>   print(\"The next value is:\", i)\n",
    "The next value is 0 \n",
    "The next value is 1 \n",
    "The next value is 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically every Python script you write will use strings, which we’ll talk about in more detail in Module 4. For now, it’s enough for you to know that they are immutable. In other words, once you create a string, it can’t be changed. But you can use `for` loops to create a new string. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `for` loops with strings to perform tasks and functions such as:\n",
    "- Reading text from a file\n",
    "- Searching for a value or specific data in a document or spreadsheet \n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip:  If you modify or update a collection of items you are using with a for loop, make sure you modify your for loop as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power of `for` loops is that they allow you to repeat sequences of any kind of data, not just a range of numbers or letters. They can help you find and use data faster. Over the next several videos and readings, you’ll get a chance to see what else you can do with loops and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 03.02.09 Reading: Looping Over a String\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping over a string allows programmers to examine each character within a string individually, gather information about its occurrences, and perform a given operation. There are multiple ways to loop over a string—some ways are more beneficial than others—and which one you choose depends on the information you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn about looping over a string, how to do it, and see some examples along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To loop over a string means to start with the first character in a string and iterate over each character until the end of the string. Strings are objects that contain a sequence of single-character strings. Yes, a single letter is classified as a string in Python. For example, `string[0]` is considered a string even though it is just a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Python does not use characters as a type like other programming languages do; it just supports strings with a length of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct—and common—way to loop over a string is to use the `for` loop. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "for char in greeting:\n",
    "\tprint(char)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `greeting` is defined as the string `'Hello'`. The loop begins with `char = 0`, which is the first element in the string. It directly calls the elements of the string and prints each element on a new line, resulting in the output below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "H\n",
    "e \n",
    "l \n",
    "l \n",
    "o \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you don’t want the elements of the string but the position of the string instead? You’re in luck because Python can work that magic too!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(len(greeting)):\n",
    "\tprint(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`len(greeting)` is an integer that tells Python how many characters are in the string. But because it’s an integer, you need to convert it to an iterable sequence by using the `range()` function. This loop does the same thing as the loop above, but instead of printing elements, it prints integers resulting in the output below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `while` Loop with Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "This `while` loop is the more “common” `while` loop that programmers often use. This type of loop involves an index variable to represent the current position within the sequence. Most of the time, this will start with 0 for the initial iteration. Let’s take a look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(greeting):\n",
    "\tprint(greeting[index])\n",
    "\tindex += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial index value is 0, and the `while` loop continues to execute as long as the index variable is less than the length of the `len(greeting)`. At each iteration, Python prints the value at the current index position `(greeting[index])`. Then, Python increments the index by 1 `(index += 1)` to move to the next position. The output of this example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "H\n",
    "e\n",
    "l \n",
    "l\n",
    "o \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro Tip: In any while loop, you can add conditional statements and stop the iteration process early so that the loop does not examine every character.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `while` Loop with Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a `while` loop with slicing accomplishes the same thing that a `while` loop with indexing does—like the example you explored above—this is just another way to write a `while` loop. You use this `while` loop in combination with string slicing to iterate over a portion of a sequence. Remember, it’s up to you to choose the method for looping over a string based on your level of comfort. There are multiple ways to write lines of code to execute the same result. Let’s explore how a `while` loop with slicing results in the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(greeting):\n",
    "    print(greeting[index:index+1])\n",
    "    index += 1\n",

    "This `while` loop continues to run as long as the index variable is less than the length of the string, which is determined by using `len(greeting)`. With each iteration, a substring of length 1 is extracted using `(greeting[index:index+1])` and printed. Then, the index is incremented by 1 `(index += 1)` to move to the next position.

    "##### List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]\n",
    "print(squared_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example starts with a list of numbers. The second line of code defines the type of transformation you want to execute on each element in the original list. In this case, you’re using this line of code to create a new list called `squared_numbers` and apply `x ** 2` to square each element in the `numbers` list. The result of each squared element is then printed in a new list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: List comprehensions can include conditional statements and nested loops, which allows for additional filtering of elements based on specific called conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Advanced String Loop Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional ways to loop over a string in Python that you should learn, practice, and master. These additional looping techniques include the generator functions, `map()`, and `zip()`. The `map()` and `zip()` functions are extremely powerful string manipulation tools that demonstrate functional programming concepts. To learn more about these advanced techniques, see these resources:\n",
    "- [Python map() Function](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-map-function)\n",
    "- [Python zip() Method](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/zip-method)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro Tip:  Looping over multiple strings at once can push the limits of `for` loops. Because of this, it’s important to be aware of other alternatives to simplify a `for` or `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "When you loop over a string, you are able to examine each individual element in the string and manipulate it how you’d like. A `for` loop iterates over each element, and a `while` loop allows you to add conditional statements and stop the iteration process early. As you saw in this reading, there are a variety of methods to loop over a string. It’s up to you to familiarize yourself with each technique and write code according to the advantages and disadvantages of each.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 03.02.10 Reading: Slice and Join Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been learning all about strings. Now it’s time to learn how to extract parts of a string—what we call “slicing” a string—or create a longer string by joining two or more strings together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing a string is just like taking a slice out of a homemade apple pie. When it comes to strings, slices can be as small or as big as you want. If you want to put two or more of those slices back together, you join them together end-to-end—in Python speak, you “concatenate” them—to make one bigger, single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn when to slice and join strings, how to do it, and see some examples along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is Slicing and Joining Strings?  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you slice a string, you extract a subset of the original string—sometimes referred to as indexing a string. Joining strings is the process of linking two or more strings together to create a bigger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Slice Strings \n",
    "\n",
    "Bracket notation, `[ ]`, is used to specify the start of the index, ending index, or both. If you do not include the starting index, then the slice contains everything from the beginning of the string to the ending index. This is the same if you do not include the ending index. Let’s look at a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pro tip: Remember that the indexes in Python start with 0, and not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string1 = \"Greetings, Earthlings\"\n",
    "print(string1[0])   # Prints “G”\n",
    "print(string1[4:8]) # Prints “ting”\n",
    "print(string1[11:]) # Prints “Earthlings”\n",
    "print(string1[:5])  # Prints “Greet”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: When you specify an ending index, Python slices everything up to, but not including the ending index. Notice in the second example the ending index is 8, but the characters sliced are 4–7.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your index is negative, Python counts back from the end of the string instead of the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(string1[-10:])     # Prints “Earthlings” again\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your index is beyond the end of the string, Python returns an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(string1[55:])     # Prints “” \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional way to slice an index is by the stride argument, indicated by using a double colon. This allows you to skip over the corresponding number of characters in your index, or if you’re using a negative stride, the string prints backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(string1[0::2])    # Prints “Getns atlns”\n",
    "print(string1[::-1])    # Prints “sgnilhtraE ,sgniteerG”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Join Strings \n",
    "\n",
    "To join strings in Python, you use the plus operator, + , just as if you were adding two numbers together. The following example joins three strings together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"world\") #Prints “Hello world”\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `join()` function, which is very useful when you want to concatenate elements from a list of strings with a specific delimiter. In the following example, we have a list of strings called greetings and we join them with a space using `.join(greetings)`. The `join()` function concatenates all the strings in the list greetings, and places a space between each string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greetings = [\"Hello\", \"world\"]\n",
    "print(\" \".join(greetings))  # Prints \"Hello world\"\n",
    "You can also concatenate a combination of strings and variables like in the following example.\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")  # Prints \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to Combine Slicing and Joining Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how to slice strings and join strings. Now, let’s put the two operations together by taking an unformatted phone number, 2025551212, and return it as a properly formatted U.S. number. In this example, we’ll use `phonenum` to refer to the unformatted phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The first 3 digits are the area code:\n",
    "\tarea_code = \"(\" + phonenum[:3] + \")\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function slices the first three numbers from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The next 3 digits are called the “exchange”:\n",
    "\texchange = phonenum[3:6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function slices the numbers 4–6 from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The next 3 digits are the line number:\n",
    "\tline = phonenum[-4:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This negative index function counts backwards from the end of the numbers, slicing the last four numbers in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Put the pieces back together into a nicely formatted string:\n",
    "\treturn area_code + \" \" + exchange + \"-\" + line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re done, your code will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def format_phone(phonenum):\n",
    "    area_code = \"(\" + phonenum[:3] + \")\"\n",
    "    exchange = phonenum[3:6]\n",
    "    line = phonenum[-4:]\n",
    "    return area_code + \" \" + exchange + \"-\" + line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll use the print function to join the three previously sliced numbers together in the correct format. With this function definition, when you call `print(format_phone(\"2025551212\"))`, it will print (202) 555-1212. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(format_phone(\"2025551212\")) # Outputs: (202) 555-1212\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing and joining strings can be beneficial to correctly format numbers, making it easier to manipulate data in a more efficient and meaningful way. Slicing strings allows you to access individual characters of a string by specifying the index. The index can be as long or as short as you like—you can even have a negative index, if counting backwards is your thing! Joining strings allows you to add two or more strings together, which is beneficial when needing to create a sentence or even properly format different numbers.\n",

    "In the `for` Loops segment, you learned about the logical structure and syntax of `for` loops. You took a closer look at the `range()` function. You learned about nested `for` loops and complex nested `for` loops with `if` statements. You also learned how to fix common errors in `for` loops.\n",

    "##### `for` Loops vs. `while` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops and `while` loops share several characteristics. Both loops can be used with a variety of data types, both can be nested, and both can be used with the keywords break and continue. However, there are important differences between the two types of loops: \n",
    "- `while` loops are used when a segment of code needs to execute repeatedly while a condition is true\n",
    "- `for` loops iterate over a sequence of elements, executing the body of the loop for each element in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "An important distinction is that for loops are suited for objects that have iterable structures. So lists, strings, ranges of integers. Individual integers are not iterable, but can be looped over by the use of the range() function, which is covered below. While loops do not iterate per se, rather they watch a truth condition \n",

    "`for` Loop with `range()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The in keyword with the `range()` function generates a sequence of integer numbers, which can be used with a `for` loop to configure the iterations of the code. The range of numbers [0, 1, 2] correlates to ordinal index positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd), rather than the cardinal (quantity) values of the numbers 0, 1, and 2. For example, range(5) means the five index positions in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function can take up to three parameters. The roles of the three possible `range(x,y,z)` parameters are:\n",
    "- `x = Start` - Starting index position of the range \n",
    "  - Default index position is 0.\n",

    "  - Example syntax: `range(y)`\n",
    "  - The value of the ending index position is excluded from the range.\n",
    "  - To include the ending index number, use the expression: `y+1` (index + 1)\n",
    "  - Example syntax: `range(x, y+1, z)`\n",
    "  - Alternatively, if `y = 10`, you can write: `range(x, 11, z)`\n",

    "It is time to prepare for the Module 3 Graded Quiz. Please review the following items from this module before beginning the Module 3 Graded Quiz. If you would like to refresh your memory on these materials, please also revisit the [while Loop Study Guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/supplement/iyNWi/study-guide-while-loops) and the [for Loop Study Guide](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/supplement/dqH6E/study-guide-for-loops) located before the Practice Quizzes in Module 3. You will not be tested on the Recursion lesson content, which is optional in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables - Know how to properly initialize or increment a variable. You will also need to recognize a coding error due to the failure to properly initialize or increment a variable.\n",
    "- Infinite loops - Know how to recognize infinite loops and use common solutions to prevent them. For example, check loop conditions, ranges, iterators, control statements, etc. to ensure that at least one of these controls are in place to prevent an infinite loop.\n",
    "- Iterators - Know the various options available for iterating a variable (e.g., using assignment operators, using the third `range()` function parameter). You will also need to analyze where the iteration should occur. A misplaced iterator could produce the wrong output or create an infinite loop.  \n",
    "- Control statements - Know how and when to use the `break` and `continue` control statements to prevent infinite loops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `range()` function parameters - know the roles of the 3 possible `range(x, y, z)` function parameters:\n",
    "  - `x` - start of range (included)\n",
    "  - `y` - end of range (excluded index) \n",
    "    - To include the end of range index, use the expression `y+1`\n",
    "    - The end of range must be included in the `range()` parameters.\n",
    "  - `z` - incremental value\n",
    "  - Example 1: `range(4, 12+1, 2)`\n",
    "    - This example creates a range that starts at 4 and ends at 12 (without the +1, the range would end at 11). \n",
    "    - The third parameter increments the range iteration by 2, as opposed to the default increment of 1. The `range(4, 12+1, 2)` expression would produce the values: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 \n",
    "  - Example 2: `range(10, 2-1, -2)`\n",
    "    - This example creates a range that starts at 10 and ends at 2-1, with a decremental value of -2. When counting down, to include the value of the end of the range index, use -1 (end of range minus 1). This range produces the sequence: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 \n",
    "- `print()` function default behavior - know the default behavior of the `print()` function is to insert a new line character after the print statement runs.\n",
    "  - To override the insertion of the new line character and replace it with a space, add `end=\" \"` as the last item in the `print()` parameters. This makes it possible to add the next print output to the same line, separated by a space. You might use this technique when a `print()` function is part of a `for` or `while` loop. Example syntax: `print(x+1, end=\" \")`\n",

    "        # The printed result is the value of \"inner_loop\". Since there aren’t any calculations in this loop, there is a simple shortcut for solving what the final value printed by the \"inner_loop\" will be. The solution is to simply use the value of the \"inner_loop\" index, which is 8.\n",

    "\n",
    "String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an `IndexError`. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access a portion of a string, called a slice or a substring. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like `[2:5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This range is similar to the `range()` function we saw previously. It includes the first number, but goes to one less than the last number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fruit = \"Mangosteen\"\n",
    ">>> fruit[1:4]\n",
    "'ang'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice includes the character at index 1, and excludes the character at index 4. You can also easily reference a substring at the start or end of the string by only specifying one end of the range. For example, only giving the end of the range:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fruit[:5]\n",
    "'Mango'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gave us the characters from the start of the string through index 4, excluding index 5. On the other hand this example gives is the characters including index 5, through the end of the string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fruit[5:]\n",
    "'steen'\n",

    "In Python, strings are immutable. This means that they can't be modified. So if we wanted to fix a typo in a string, we can't simply modify the wrong character. We would have to create a new string with the typo corrected. We can also assign a new value to the variable holding our string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we aren't sure what the index of our typo is, we can use the string method index to locate it and return the index. Let's imagine we have the string `\"lions tigers and bears\"` in the variable `animals`. We can locate the index that contains the letter `g` using animals.index(\"g\"), which will return the index; in this case 8. We can also use substrings to locate the index where the substring begins. animals.index(\"bears\") would return 17, since that’s the start of the substring. If there’s more than one match for a substring, the index method will return the first match. If we try to locate a substring that doesn't exist in the string, we’ll receive a `ValueError` explaining that the substring was not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = \"lions tigers and bears\"\n",

    "animals = \"lions tigers and bears\"\n",

    "We can avoid a ValueError by first checking if the substring exists in the string. This can be done using the `in` keyword. We saw this keyword earlier when we covered for loops. In this case, it's a conditional that will be either True or False. If the substring is found in the string, it will be True. If the substring is not found in the string, it will be False. Using our previous variable `animals`, we can do `\"horses\" in animals` to check if the substring \"horses\" is found in our variable. In this case, it would evaluate to False, since horses aren’t included in our example string. If we did `\"tigers\" in animals`, we'd get True, since this substring is contained in our string.\n",

    "#### 04.01.12 Reading: Advanced String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered a bunch of String class methods already, so let's keep building on those and run down some more advanced methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string method `lower()` will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the `upper()` method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like `\"this is a string\".upper()`. This would return the string `\"THIS IS A STRING\"`. This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `strip()` method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `count()` can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method `endswith()`. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `isnumeric()` method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the `int()` function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the `join()` method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, `\" \".join([\"This\",\"is\",\"a\",\"sentence\"])` would return the string `\"This is a sentence\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of the join method is the `split()` method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter.\n",

    "#### 04.01.15 Reading: String Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `format()` method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, `{}`, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using `.format()` and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression `{:.2f}` means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: `>`. For example, the expression `{:>3.2f}` would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output.\n",

    "The way to do this in Python is by formatting strings in your output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers different ways to format strings. In the Formatting Strings video, we explained the `format()` method. In this reading, we'll highlight three different ways of formatting strings. For this course you need to know only the `format()` method. But on the internet, you might find any of the three, so it's a good idea to know that the others exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using the `format()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `format()` method takes a string containing special placeholders, called the format string, and replaces the special placeholder characters `{}` with the value of the arguments you pass. The arguments are converted to strings if they weren’t already. The number of arguments you pass must exactly match the number of placeholders in the format string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit = \"peaches\"\n",
    "weight = 3.0\n",
    "per_pound = 2.99\n",
    "output = \"You are buying {} pounds of {} at {} per pound.\".format(weight, fruit, per_pound)\n",
    "print(output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are buying 3.0 pounds of peaches at 2.99 per pound.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also consume the arguments to `format()` in any order you want by specifying the index inside the placeholder. As with lists and arrays, the index always starts with 0. You can even use an index more than once. Here you can see we’re using the second argument twice. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = \"{1} are {2} per pound, and you have {0} pounds of {1}.\".format(weight, fruit, per_pound)\n",
    "print(output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Peaches are 2.99 per pound, and you have 3.0 pounds of peaches.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A third option for the placeholders is to use field names instead of indexes. This can make your code much more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = \"{fruit} are {price} per pound, and you have {weight} pounds of {fruit}.\".format(weight=weight, fruit=fruit, price=per_pound)\n",
    "print(output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Peaches are 2.99 per pound, and you have 3.0 pounds of peaches.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also gives you many options to control the appearance of the output. Remember the messy output from the first example? You can have Python automatically round things up to the nearest penny and produce nice output by using a formatting expression. In the example below, the code tells Python to round up the numbers to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Print the receipt for the customer. The format string \":10,.2f\" \n",
    "# works as follows:\n",
    "#   - \":10\" makes the output 10 characters wide.\n",
    "#   - \",\" inserts thousands separators between groups of digits.\n",
    "#   - \".2\" limits the output to two digits after the decimal.\n",
    "#   - \"f\" tells Python to expect a floating-point number.\n",
    "#\n",
    "print(\"Subtotal:     ${:10,.2f}\".format(subtotal))\n",
    "print(\"Sales Tax:    ${:10,.2f}\".format(tax_amt))\n",
    "print(\"Total:        ${:10,.2f}\".format(total))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Subtotal:     $    27.25 \n",
    "Sales Tax:    $     1.80 \n",
    "Total:        $    29.05\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything inside the placeholder after the “`:`” colon is part of the formatting expression. The expression “`:10,.2f`” means “make the output 10 characters wide, use digit separators if the amount is over 1000, output no more than 2 digits after the decimal, and expect the input to be a floating-point decimal number”. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following table gives you some more examples of formatting expressions:\n",

    "\n",
    "A formatted string literal or f-string is a string that starts with `'f'` or `'F'` before the quotes. These strings might contain `{}` placeholders using expressions like the ones used for `format()` method strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important difference between f-strings and the `format()` method is that f-strings take the value of the variables from the current context, instead of taking the values from parameters.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    ">>> name = \"Micah\"\n",
    ">>> print(f'Hello {name}')\n",
    "Hello Micah\n",
    ">>> item = \"Purple Cup\"\n",
    ">>> amount = 5\n",
    ">>> price = amount * 3.25\n",
    ">>> print(f'Item: {item} - Amount: {amount} - Price: {price:.2f}')\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Old String Formatting (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `format()` method was introduced in Python 2.6. Before that, the `%` (modulo) operator could be used to get a similar result. Although this method is no longer recommended for new code, you might come across it in someone else's code. This is what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"base string with %s placeholder\" % variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%` (modulo) operator returns a copy of the string where the placeholders indicated by % followed by a formatting expression are replaced by the variables after the operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "To replace more than one value, you need to supply the values as a tuple. The formatting expression must match the value type. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"base string with %d and %d placeholders\" % (value1, value2)\n",
    "```\n",

    "- `string[x]` - String operation that accesses the character at index [x] of the string, where indexing starts at zero.\n",
    "- `string[x:y]` - String operation that accesses a substring starting at index [x] and ending at index [y-1]. If x is omitted, its value defaults to 0. If y is omitted, the value will default to len(string).\n",

    "- Add a character to the end of a string.\n",
    "- Use the `.lower()` string method to convert the case (uppercase/lowercase) of the letters within a string variable. This method is often used to eliminate cases as a factor when comparing two strings. For example, all lowercase “cat” is not equal to “Cat” because “Cat” contains an uppercase letter. To be able to compare the two strings to see if they are the same word, you can use the .lower() string method to remove capitalization as a factor in the string comparison.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are defined using square brackets, with the elements stored in the list separated by commas: `my_list = [\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"list\"]`. You can use the `len()` function to return the number of elements in a list: `len(my_list)` would return 4. You can also use the in keyword to check if a list contains a certain element. If the element is present, it will return a True boolean. If the element is not found in the list, it will return False. For example, `\"This\" in my_list` would return True in our example. Similar to strings, lists can also use indexing to access specific elements in a list based on their position. You can access the first element in a list by doing `my_list[0]`, which would allow you to access the string `\"This\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists and strings are quite similar. They’re both examples of sequences of data. Sequences have similar properties, like (1) being able to iterate over them using `for` loops; (2) support indexing; (3) using the `len()` function to find the length of the sequence; (4) using the plus operator `+` in order to concatenate; and (5) using the `in` keyword to check if the sequence contains a value. Understanding these concepts allows you to apply them to other sequence types as well.\n",

    "#### 04.02.08 Reading: Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, strings and lists are both examples of sequences. Strings are sequences of characters, and are immutable. Lists are sequences of elements of any data type, and are mutable. The third sequence type is the tuple. Tuples are like lists, since they can contain elements of any data type. But unlike lists, tuples are immutable. They’re specified using parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why tuples are a thing, given how similar they are to lists. Tuples can be useful when we need to ensure that an element is in a certain position and will not change. Since lists are mutable, the order of the elements can be changed on us. Since the order of the elements in a tuple can't be changed, the position of the element in a tuple can have meaning. A good example of this is when a function returns multiple values. In this case, what gets returned is a tuple, with the return values as elements in the tuple. The order of the returned values is important, and a tuple ensures that the order isn’t going to change. Storing the elements of a tuple in separate variables is called unpacking. This allows you to take multiple returned values from a function and store each value in its own variable.\n",

### Module 1 Review

#### Qwiklabs Assessment: Introduction to Git

##### Introduction

In this scenario, you are a project lead in an IT company. You and your team are working on a huge project, which consists of multiple functionalities and modules. This project is evolving over time and so your team is expecting a lot of code revisions. In this lab, you'll learn how to use a distributed version control system called Git. You'll also discover how to connect to a VM instance, install Git, and configure your Git user information. Next, you'll create a local Git repository, add a file to the repository, and do some basic operations like adding a file, editing files, and making commits.

What you'll do

- Create a git repository.
- Add files to this repository
- Edit the files
- Commit the changes to the repository.

You'll have 90 minutes to complete this lab.

###### Start the lab

You'll need to start the lab before you can access the materials in the virtual machine OS. To do this, click the green “Start Lab” button at the top of the screen.

Note: For this lab you are going to access the Linux VM through your local SSH Client, and not use the Google Console (Open GCP Console button is not available for this lab).

</p>

After you click the “Start Lab” button, you will see all the SSH connection details on the left-hand side of your screen. You should have a screen that looks like this:
